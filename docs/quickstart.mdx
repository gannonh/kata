## Installation

Choose your installation method:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin Install (Recommended)
/plugin marketplace add gannonh/kata-marketplace
/plugin install kata@gannonh-kata-marketplace
```

```bash NPM Install
npx @gannonh/kata
```

</CodeGroup>

## Verify Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin
/kata:providing-help
```

```bash NPX
/kata-providing-help
```

</CodeGroup>

## Your First Project

### 1. Start a New Project

```
"Start a new project"
```

Or use the explicit command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin
/kata:starting-projects
```

```bash NPX
/kata-starting-projects
```

</CodeGroup>

The system will:
1. Ask questions until it understands your idea completely
2. Optionally spawn research agents to investigate the domain
3. Extract requirements (v1, v2, out of scope)
4. Create a roadmap with phases mapped to requirements

### 2. Plan Your First Phase

```
"Plan phase 1"
```

Or explicitly:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin
/kata:planning-phases 1
```

```bash NPX
/kata-planning-phases 1
```

</CodeGroup>

The system will:
1. Research how to implement the phase
2. Create 2-3 atomic task plans with XML structure
3. Verify plans against requirements

### 3. Execute the Phase

```
"Execute phase 1"
```

Or explicitly:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin
/kata:executing-phases 1
```

```bash NPX
/kata-executing-phases 1
```

</CodeGroup>

The system will:
1. Run plans in parallel waves
2. Give each plan a fresh 200k context window
3. Create atomic commits per task
4. Verify work against phase goals

### 4. Verify the Work

```
"Verify phase 1"
```

Or explicitly:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin
/kata:verifying-phases 1
```

```bash NPX
/kata-verifying-phases 1
```

</CodeGroup>

The system will:
1. Extract testable deliverables
2. Walk you through verification steps
3. Diagnose failures automatically if issues found
4. Create fix plans ready for re-execution

## Natural Language Commands

Kata responds to natural language. You don't need to memorize slash commands:

| You say...               | Kata does...                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| "Start a new project"    | Launches full project initialization   |
| "What's the status?"     | Shows progress, next steps, blockers   |
| "Plan phase 2"           | Researches and creates execution plans |
| "Execute the phase"      | Runs all plans with parallel agents    |
| "I'm done for today"     | Creates handoff for session resumption |

## Recommended Setup

Kata is designed for frictionless automation. Run Claude Code with:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

<Tip>
Kata works best this way. Approving `date` and `git commit` 50 times defeats the purpose.
</Tip>

Alternatively, configure granular permissions in `.claude/settings.json`. See [Installation](/installation) for details.
