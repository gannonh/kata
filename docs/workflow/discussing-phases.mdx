title: 'Discussing Phases'
description: 'Capture implementation decisions before planning'
---

## Overview

The `discussing-phases` skill captures implementation decisions before research and planning. This ensures Claude understands your preferences and builds features the way you envision them.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- You have specific preferences for how something should be built
- The phase involves UI/UX decisions
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- You want to shape the implementation direction

Skip it for phases where you're comfortable with Claude's defaults.

## Invocation

```
"Let's discuss phase 1"
```

Or explicitly:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin
/kata:discussing-phases 1
```

```bash NPX
/kata-discussing-phases 1
```

</CodeGroup>

## What Gets Captured

Based on what's being built, the system identifies gray areas:

- **Visual features** → Layout, density, interactions, empty states
- **APIs/CLIs** → Response format, flags, error handling, verbosity
- **Content systems** → Structure, tone, depth, flow
- **Organization tasks** → Grouping criteria, naming, duplicates

For each area you select, it asks until you're satisfied.

## Output

Creates `{phase}-CONTEXT.md` which feeds into:
1. **Researcher** — Knows what patterns to investigate
2. **Planner** — Knows what decisions are locked

## Next Steps

After discussing, proceed to:
- [Planning Phases](/workflow/planning-phases) — Research and create execution plans
