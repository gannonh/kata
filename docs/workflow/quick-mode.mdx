title: 'Quick Mode'
description: 'Execute ad-hoc tasks without full planning'
---

## Overview

Quick mode provides Kata guarantees (atomic commits, state tracking) with a faster path for small, self-contained tasks.

## When to Use

**Use quick mode for:**
- Bug fixes
- Small features
- Config changes
- One-off tasks

**Use full planning for:**
- Tasks involving multiple subsystems
- Work requiring investigation
- Tasks that are part of larger phases
- Complex changes

## Invocation

```
"Quick task: add dark mode toggle"
```

Or explicitly:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin
/kata:executing-quick-tasks
```

```bash NPX
/kata-executing-quick-tasks
```

</CodeGroup>

## What's Different

### Same Quality
- Same agents (planner + executor)
- Same atomic commits
- Same state tracking

### Faster Path
- Skips research phase
- Skips plan checker loop
- Skips verifier agent
- Separate tracking (`.planning/quick/`)

## Workflow

1. Get task description
2. Spawn planner (with quick constraints)
3. Spawn executor
4. Update STATE.md
5. Commit artifacts

## Output Files

```
.planning/quick/
├── 001-add-dark-mode/
│   ├── PLAN.md
│   └── SUMMARY.md
├── 002-fix-login-bug/
│   ├── PLAN.md
│   └── SUMMARY.md
```

Numbering: 3-digit sequential (001, 002, 003...)

## Tracking

Quick tasks update STATE.md, NOT ROADMAP.md:

```markdown
### Quick Tasks Completed

| #   | Description          | Date       | Commit  |
| --- | -------------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 001 | Add dark mode toggle | 2026-01-19 | abc123f |
```

## Commit Convention

```
docs(quick-001): add dark mode toggle

Quick task completed.
