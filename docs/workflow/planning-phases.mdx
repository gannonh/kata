## Overview

The `planning-phases` skill researches how to implement a phase, creates atomic task plans, and verifies they achieve phase goals.

## Invocation

```
"Plan phase 1"
```

Or explicitly:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin
/kata:planning-phases 1
```

```bash NPX
/kata-planning-phases 1
```

</CodeGroup>

## Workflow

### 1. Research

Spawns `kata-phase-researcher` agent to investigate:
- Technology choices
- Implementation patterns
- Library recommendations
- Common pitfalls

Guided by CONTEXT.md decisions from discuss phase (if it exists).

### 2. Planning

Spawns `kata-planner` agent to create 2-3 atomic task plans with XML structure.

Each plan contains:
- Specific tasks with verification steps
- File paths to be modified
- Implementation guidance
- Success criteria

### 3. Verification

Spawns `kata-plan-checker` agent to verify:
- Phase goals achieved?
- Requirements covered?
- Dependencies clear?
- Verification steps specified?

Loops until plans pass verification.

## Options

### Skip Research

```bash
/kata:planning-phases 1 --skip-research
```

Use when you're confident about the approach and don't need domain investigation.

### Skip Verification

```bash
/kata:planning-phases 1 --skip-verify
```

Skip the plan checker loop. Useful for quick iterations.

## Output Files

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| {phase}-RESEARCH.md | Domain investigation findings |
| {phase}-{N}-PLAN.md | Atomic task plans with XML structure |
