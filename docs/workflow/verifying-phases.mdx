description: 'Manual user acceptance testing'

## Overview

The `verifying-phases` skill guides you through manual testing of completed work and automatically diagnoses failures.

## Invocation

```
"Verify phase 1"
```

Or explicitly:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin
/kata:verifying-phases 1
```

```bash NPX
/kata-verifying-phases 1
```

</CodeGroup>

## Workflow

### 1. Extract Deliverables

System identifies testable deliverables from phase goals and VERIFICATION.md.

### 2. Manual Testing

Walks you through verification steps one at a time:
- "Can you log in with email?" → Yes/No/Issue
- "Do invalid credentials return 401?" → Yes/No/Issue

### 3. Automatic Diagnosis

If issues found, spawns `kata-debugger` agent to:
- Investigate root cause
- Propose fix
- Create verified fix plan

### 4. Fix Plan Generation

Creates new plan ready for immediate execution:

```bash
/kata:executing-phases 1
```

Fix plans integrate back into the phase.

## Output Files

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| {phase}-UAT.md | User acceptance testing results |
| {phase}-{N}-PLAN.md | Fix plans if issues found |

## Pass Criteria

Phase verified when:
- All deliverables manually tested
- All tests pass
- No blocking issues remain

## Next Steps

If verification passes, proceed to next phase:
- [Planning Phases](/workflow/planning-phases) — Plan the next phase

If issues found, re-execute with fix plans:
- [Executing Phases](/workflow/executing-phases) — Run fix plans
