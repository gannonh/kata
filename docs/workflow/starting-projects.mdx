title: 'Starting Projects'
description: 'Initialize a new project with Kata'
---

## Overview

The `starting-projects` skill launches full project initialization: questions → research → requirements → roadmap.

## Invocation

```
"Start a new project"
```

Or explicitly:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin
/kata:starting-projects
```

```bash NPX
/kata-starting-projects
```

</CodeGroup>

## Workflow

### 1. Questions

The system asks until it understands your idea completely:
- Project goals
- Technology preferences
- Constraints
- Edge cases
- User experience requirements

### 2. Research (Optional)

Spawns 4 parallel research agents:
- **Stack researcher** — Investigates technology choices
- **Feature researcher** — Explores similar product features
- **Architecture researcher** — Evaluates structural patterns
- **Pitfalls researcher** — Identifies common mistakes

Research is optional but recommended for unfamiliar domains.

### 3. Requirements

Extracts and categorizes requirements:
- **v1** — Must-have for initial release
- **v2** — Nice-to-have for future
- **Out of scope** — Explicitly excluded

### 4. Roadmap

Creates phases mapped to requirements. Each phase has:
- Name and description
- Goals (what must be delivered)
- Traced requirements
- Dependencies

## Output Files

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| PROJECT.md | Project vision, always loaded |
| REQUIREMENTS.md | Scoped requirements with phase traceability |
| ROADMAP.md | Phase breakdown and progress tracking |
| STATE.md | Living memory across sessions |
| research/ | Domain investigation findings (if research enabled) |

## Next Steps

After initialization, proceed to:

1. **Discuss Phase 1** — Capture implementation decisions ([discussing-phases](/workflow/discussing-phases))
2. **Plan Phase 1** — Research and create execution plans ([planning-phases](/workflow/planning-phases))
3. **Execute Phase 1** — Run plans with fresh context ([executing-phases](/workflow/executing-phases))
4. **Verify Phase 1** — Manual acceptance testing ([verifying-phases](/workflow/verifying-phases))

See [Quickstart](/quickstart) for the complete workflow.
