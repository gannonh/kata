title: 'Executing Phases'
description: 'Run plans with fresh context and atomic commits'
---

## Overview

The `executing-phases` skill executes all plans in a phase using parallel waves, fresh context per plan, and atomic commits per task.

## Invocation

```
"Execute phase 1"
```

Or explicitly:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Plugin
/kata:executing-phases 1
```

```bash NPX
/kata-executing-phases 1
```

</CodeGroup>

## Workflow

### 1. Wave Grouping

Plans are grouped into waves based on dependencies:

```
Wave 1 (parallel):
  - Plan 1 (no dependencies)
  - Plan 2 (no dependencies)

Wave 2 (parallel):
  - Plan 3 (depends on Plan 1)
  - Plan 4 (depends on Plan 2)
```

### 2. Parallel Execution

Spawns `kata-executor` agent per plan with:
- Fresh 200k token context
- Plan instructions
- Project context
- State information

Agents work simultaneously within each wave.

### 3. Atomic Commits

Each task creates its own commit immediately after completion:

```bash
abc123f feat(02-01): implement login endpoint
def456g feat(02-01): add password hashing
hij789k test(02-01): add login flow tests
```

Commit format: `{type}({phase}-{plan}): {description}`

### 4. Verification

After all plans complete, spawns `kata-verifier` agent to check:
- Phase goals delivered?
- Requirements satisfied?
- Code quality acceptable?

## Output Files

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| {phase}-{N}-SUMMARY.md | Post-execution record |
| {phase}-VERIFICATION.md | Goal verification results |

## Next Steps

After execution, proceed to:
