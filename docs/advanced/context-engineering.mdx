## The Context Problem

Claude's quality degrades as context fills up. At 70%+ context usage, quality drops significantly.

## Kata's Solution

Manage context deliberately through:

1. **Thin orchestrators** — Stay at ~30% context
2. **Fresh agent contexts** — 200k tokens per spawn
3. **Progressive disclosure** — Load only what's needed
4. **Structured state** — Memory across sessions

## Quality Curve

| Context Level | Quality    | Strategy                  |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| 0-30%         | Peak       | Orchestrators stay here   |
| 30-50%        | Good       | Acceptable for light work |
| 50-70%        | Degrading  | Time to wrap up           |
| 70%+          | Poor       | Spawn fresh agent         |

## Context Flow

```
Main Context (Orchestrator)
    ↓ Load minimal context
PROJECT.md + REQUIREMENTS.md + Current phase
    ↓ Spawn agent
Agent Context (Fresh 200k)
    ↓ Work completes
Results return
    ↓
Main Context still at ~30%
```

## File-Based Context

| File | Purpose | Always Loaded? |
| ---- | ------- | -------------- |
| PROJECT.md | Project vision | Yes |
| REQUIREMENTS.md | Scoped requirements | For planning/execution |
| ROADMAP.md | Phase structure | For navigation |
| STATE.md | Session memory | For resuming |
| PLAN.md | Task instructions | For execution only |

## Progressive Disclosure

Use `@-references` to load context on demand:

```markdown
@~/.claude/kata/workflows/phase-execute.md
@.planning/PROJECT.md
```

Only load when actually needed.

## Size Constraints

Based on where quality degrades:

- **Plans:** 2-3 tasks max
- **Context usage:** Orchestrators under 30%
- **Task scope:** >5 files → split
- **Phase scope:** >3 plans → consider splitting
