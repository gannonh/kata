## What Are Skills?

Skills are the primary interface for all Kata workflows. They're user-invocable commands that respond to both natural language and explicit slash command invocation.

## Invocation Methods

### Natural Language (Recommended)

```
"Plan phase 2"
"What's the status?"
"Execute the phase"
"I'm done for today"
```

Kata parses intent and routes to the appropriate skill automatically.

### Explicit Commands

| Installation | Syntax               | Example                   |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Plugin       | `/kata:skill-name`   | `/kata:planning-phases 2` |
| NPX          | `/kata-skill-name`   | `/kata-planning-phases 2` |

Use explicit commands when you need precision or want to bypass intent recognition.

## Skill Architecture

Skills are **thin orchestrators**. They:

1. Load necessary context
2. Spawn specialized agents
3. Collect results
4. Route to next step

**Key principle:** Skills stay lean (~15% context). Heavy lifting happens in fresh agent contexts.

```
Skill (30% context)
    ↓
Spawns Agent (fresh 200k)
    ↓
Agent completes work
    ↓
Returns results
    ↓
Skill stays at 30%
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows a consistent pattern:

```
skills/kata-{name}/
├── SKILL.md         # Orchestrator workflow (<500 lines)
└── references/      # Progressive disclosure
    ├── {topic}.md
    └── ...
```

The main SKILL.md file contains the orchestration logic. Detailed documentation lives in `references/` for progressive disclosure.

## Core Workflow Skills

### starting-projects

**Purpose:** Full project initialization

**Flow:**
1. Questions → understand requirements
2. Research → investigate domain (optional)
3. Requirements → extract v1, v2, out of scope
4. Roadmap → create phase structure

**Creates:** `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`

### planning-phases

**Purpose:** Research and plan a single phase

**Flow:**
1. Research → investigate implementation approach
2. Plan → create 2-3 atomic task plans
3. Verify → check against requirements

**Creates:** `{phase}-RESEARCH.md`, `{phase}-{N}-PLAN.md`

### executing-phases

**Purpose:** Execute all plans in a phase

**Flow:**
1. Group plans into waves (parallel/sequential)
2. Spawn executor per plan with fresh context
3. Atomic commit per task
4. Verify against phase goals

**Creates:** `{phase}-{N}-SUMMARY.md`, `{phase}-VERIFICATION.md`

### verifying-phases

**Purpose:** Manual user acceptance testing

**Flow:**
1. Extract testable deliverables
2. Walk through verification steps
3. Diagnose failures automatically
4. Create fix plans if issues found

**Creates:** `{phase}-UAT.md`, fix plans if needed

## Navigation Skills

### tracking-progress

**Purpose:** Show current position and next steps

**Output:**
- Current phase and progress
- Blockers and decisions
- Next recommended action
- Available options

### providing-help

**Purpose:** List all skills and usage

**Output:**
- Complete skill reference
- Invocation syntax
- Common workflows

## Phase Management Skills

### adding-phases

Add a new phase to the end of the roadmap.

### inserting-phases

Insert urgent work between existing phases. Uses decimal numbering (e.g., 2.1 between 2 and 3).

### removing-phases

Remove a future phase and renumber remaining phases.

## Utility Skills

### executing-quick-tasks

Execute ad-hoc tasks without full planning overhead.

**Use for:**
- Bug fixes
- Small features
- Config changes
- One-off tasks

**Creates:** `.planning/quick/{NNN}-{slug}/PLAN.md`, `SUMMARY.md`

### debugging

Systematic debugging with persistent state tracking.

### pausing-work / resuming-work

Create session handoffs and restore context.

## Skill Naming Conventions

Skills follow strict naming patterns for autonomous invocation:

1. **Gerund (verb-ing) style** — `kata-managing-todos` not `kata-todo-management`
2. **Exhaustive trigger phrases** — List every phrase users might say
3. **Verbose and specific** — `kata-providing-progress-and-status-updates` over `kata-status`

**Why this matters:** Claude matches skills based on name and description before falling back to defaults. Better naming = better autonomous routing.

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills use `@-references` to load context progressively:

```markdown
@~/.claude/kata/workflows/phase-execute.md
@~/.claude/kata/templates/plan.md
@.planning/PROJECT.md
```

Only load what's needed. Keep the main skill file focused on orchestration.

## Subagent Spawning

Skills spawn agents via the Task tool:

```xml
<task>
  <spawn agent="kata-planner">
    <context>
      @.planning/PROJECT.md
      @.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
      Phase 2 requirements
    </context>
  </spawn>
</task>
```

The agent works in a fresh 200k window. Results return to the skill for integration.

## Quality Constraints

- **SKILL.md:** Under 500 lines
- **Context usage:** Stay under 30%
- **Heavy work:** Spawn agents
- **Documentation:** Move to `references/`
