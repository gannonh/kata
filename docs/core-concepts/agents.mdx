## Overview

Agents are specialized subagents spawned by skills for specific tasks. Each agent works in a fresh 200k token context window, preventing context degradation that would occur if all work happened in the main orchestrator.

## Core Agents

### kata-planner

**Purpose:** Create atomic task plans with XML structure

**Spawned by:** `kata-planning-phases`

**Input:**
- Phase requirements
- Research findings
- Project context

**Output:** `{phase}-{N}-PLAN.md` with structured tasks

### kata-executor

**Purpose:** Implement tasks from plans

**Spawned by:** `kata-executing-phases`

**Input:**
- Single PLAN.md file
- Project context
- State information

**Output:** Code changes, atomic commits, SUMMARY.md

### kata-verifier

**Purpose:** Check work against phase goals

**Spawned by:** `kata-executing-phases`, `kata-verifying-phases`

**Input:**
- Phase goals
- Completed work
- Codebase state

**Output:** Verification results, gap analysis

### kata-debugger

**Purpose:** Diagnose failures systematically

**Spawned by:** `kata-verifying-phases`, `kata-debugging`

**Input:**
- Failure description
- Relevant code
- Execution context

**Output:** Root cause analysis, fix plan

### kata-phase-researcher

**Purpose:** Investigate domain before planning

**Spawned by:** `kata-planning-phases`

**Input:**
- Phase description
- Technology stack
- Constraints

**Output:** `{phase}-RESEARCH.md` with findings

## Orchestration Pattern

```
Orchestrator (Skill)
    ↓ (spawns)
Agent 1 (fresh 200k)
    ↓ (completes)
Results to Orchestrator
    ↓ (spawns)
Agent 2 (fresh 200k)
    ↓ (completes)
Results to Orchestrator
```

The orchestrator never accumulates context garbage from agent work.

## Agent Constraints

- **Context size:** Fresh 200k tokens per spawn
- **Focus:** Single responsibility
- **Communication:** Results only, no streaming
- **State:** Stateless (orchestrator manages state)

## Parallel Execution

Multiple agents can run simultaneously:

```
Orchestrator
    ↓
├─ Agent 1 (wave 1)
├─ Agent 2 (wave 1)
└─ Agent 3 (wave 1)
    ↓ (all complete)
├─ Agent 4 (wave 2)
└─ Agent 5 (wave 2)
```

Plans are grouped into waves based on dependencies. Independent work runs in parallel.
