## Overview

Templates define structured output formats that ensure consistency across planning, execution, and verification. They're stored in `kata/templates/` and loaded by agents as needed.

## Core Templates

### PROJECT.md

**Purpose:** Project vision, always loaded in context

**Contains:**
- Project name and description
- Goals and success criteria
- Technology stack
- Constraints and preferences

**Created by:** `kata-starting-projects`

### REQUIREMENTS.md

**Purpose:** Scoped requirements with phase traceability

**Structure:**
- v1 (must-have)
- v2 (nice-to-have)
- Out of scope

**Created by:** `kata-starting-projects`

### ROADMAP.md

**Purpose:** Phase breakdown and progress tracking

**Contains:**
- Milestones
- Phases with goals
- Status indicators
- Dependencies

**Created by:** `kata-starting-projects`

### PLAN.md

**Purpose:** Atomic task plan with XML structure

**Structure:**
```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Task name</name>
  <files>affected files</files>
  <action>precise instructions</action>
  <verify>verification command</verify>
  <done>acceptance criteria</done>
</task>
```

**Created by:** `kata-planner`

### SUMMARY.md

**Purpose:** Post-execution record of what happened

**Contains:**
- Tasks completed
- Files changed
- Commits created
- Issues encountered

**Created by:** `kata-executor`

### STATE.md

**Purpose:** Living memory across sessions

**Contains:**
- Current position
- Decisions made
- Blockers
- Context for resuming

**Updated by:** All skills

## Template Usage

Agents load templates via `@-references`:

```markdown
@~/.claude/kata/templates/plan.md
```

Templates show agents what good output looks like without inflating the orchestrator's context.

## Frontmatter

Templates use YAML frontmatter for machine-readable metadata:

```yaml
---
type: plan
phase: 2
plan: 1
dependencies: []
---
```

This enables dependency tracking and automated routing.
