## What is Kata?

Kata is an **agent orchestration framework** for spec-driven development. It's a meta-prompting and context engineering system that helps Claude build software systematically through structured workflows:

**Requirements gathering → Research → Planning → Execution → Verification**

型 · /ˈkɑːtɑː/ · *noun* - a choreographed pattern practiced repeatedly until perfected

## Key Design Principles

### Plans ARE Prompts

PLAN.md files are executable XML documents optimized for Claude, not prose to be transformed. Every plan is structured for direct consumption by execution agents.

### Files Teach Claude

Every file in Kata serves dual purposes:
1. **Runtime functionality** — Loaded by Claude during execution
2. **Teaching material** — Shows Claude how to build software systematically

### Fresh Context Windows

Orchestrators stay lean (~15% context), subagents get fresh 200k tokens each. Walk away, come back to completed work without accumulated context garbage.

## Architecture

**Core Components:**
- **Skills** (`skills/kata-*/SKILL.md`) — Primary interface for all Kata workflows
- **Agents** (`agents/kata-*.md`) — Specialized subagents spawned by skills
- **Templates** (`kata/templates/`) — Structured output formats (PROJECT.md, PLAN.md)
- **References** (`kata/references/`) — Deep-dive documentation on concepts
