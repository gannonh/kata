# Research Protocol

Detailed guidance for phase research methodology and RESEARCH.md structure.

## Research Philosophy

### Claude's Training as Hypothesis

Claude's training data is 6-18 months stale. Treat pre-existing knowledge as hypothesis, not fact.

**The trap:** Claude "knows" things confidently. But that knowledge may be:
- Outdated (library has new major version)
- Incomplete (feature was added after training)
- Wrong (Claude misremembered or hallucinated)

**The discipline:**
1. **Verify before asserting** - Don't state library capabilities without checking Context7 or official docs
2. **Date your knowledge** - "As of my training" is a warning flag, not a confidence marker
3. **Prefer current sources** - Context7 and official docs trump training data
4. **Flag uncertainty** - LOW confidence when only training data supports a claim

### Honest Reporting

Research value comes from accuracy, not completeness theater.

**Report honestly:**
- "I couldn't find X" is valuable (now we know to investigate differently)
- "This is LOW confidence" is valuable (flags for validation)
- "Sources contradict" is valuable (surfaces real ambiguity)
- "I don't know" is valuable (prevents false confidence)

**Avoid:**
- Padding findings to look complete
- Stating unverified claims as facts
- Hiding uncertainty behind confident language
- Pretending WebSearch results are authoritative

## Tool Strategy

### Context7: First for Libraries

Context7 provides authoritative, current documentation for libraries and frameworks.

**When to use:**
- Any question about a library's API
- How to use a framework feature
- Current version capabilities
- Configuration options

**How to use:**
```
1. Resolve library ID:
   mcp__context7__resolve-library-id with libraryName: "[library name]"

2. Query documentation:
   mcp__context7__query-docs with:
   - libraryId: [resolved ID]
   - query: "[specific question]"
```

**Best practices:**
- Resolve first, then query (don't guess IDs)
- Use specific queries for focused results
- Query multiple topics if needed
- Trust Context7 over training data

### Official Docs via WebFetch

For libraries not in Context7 or for authoritative sources.

**When to use:**
- Library not in Context7
- Need to verify changelog/release notes
- Official blog posts or announcements
- GitHub README or wiki

**How to use:**
```
WebFetch with exact URL:
- https://docs.library.com/getting-started
- https://github.com/org/repo/releases
- https://official-blog.com/announcement
```

**Best practices:**
- Use exact URLs, not search results pages
- Check publication dates
- Prefer /docs/ paths over marketing pages

### WebSearch: Ecosystem Discovery

For finding what exists, community patterns, real-world usage.

**When to use:**
- "What libraries exist for X?"
- "How do people solve Y?"
- "Common mistakes with Z"

**Query templates (use current year):**
```
Stack discovery:
- "[technology] best practices 2025"
- "[technology] recommended libraries 2025"

Pattern discovery:
- "how to build [type of thing] with [technology]"
- "[technology] architecture patterns"

Problem discovery:
- "[technology] common mistakes"
- "[technology] gotchas"
```

**Best practices:**
- Include current year for freshness
- Use multiple query variations
- Cross-verify findings with authoritative sources
- Mark WebSearch-only findings as LOW confidence

### Verification Protocol

**CRITICAL:** WebSearch findings must be verified.

```
For each WebSearch finding:

1. Can I verify with Context7?
   YES -> Query Context7, upgrade to HIGH confidence
   NO -> Continue to step 2

2. Can I verify with official docs?
   YES -> WebFetch official source, upgrade to MEDIUM confidence
   NO -> Remains LOW confidence, flag for validation

3. Do multiple sources agree?
   YES -> Increase confidence one level
   NO -> Note contradiction, investigate further
```

**Never present LOW confidence findings as authoritative.**

## RESEARCH.md Structure

Write to: `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-RESEARCH.md`

```markdown
# Phase [X]: [Name] - Research

**Researched:** [date]
**Domain:** [primary technology/problem domain]
**Confidence:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

## Summary

[2-3 paragraph executive summary]
- What was researched
- What the standard approach is
- Key recommendations

**Primary recommendation:** [one-liner actionable guidance]

## Standard Stack

The established libraries/tools for this domain:

### Core
| Library | Version | Purpose | Why Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| [name] | [ver] | [what it does] | [why experts use it] |

### Supporting
| Library | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| [name] | [ver] | [what it does] | [use case] |

### Alternatives Considered

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **[Anti-pattern]:** [why it's bad, what to do instead]

## Don't Hand-Roll

Problems that look simple but have existing solutions:

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| [problem] | [what you'd build] | [library] | [edge cases, complexity] |

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------|

   - What's unclear: [the gap]
   - Recommendation: [how to handle]

## Sources

### Primary (HIGH confidence)
- [Context7 library ID] - [topics fetched]
- [Official docs URL] - [what was checked]

### Secondary (MEDIUM confidence)
- [WebSearch verified with official source]

### Tertiary (LOW confidence)
- [WebSearch only, marked for validation]

## Metadata

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Standard stack: [level] - [reason]
- Architecture: [level] - [reason]
- Pitfalls: [level] - [reason]

**Research date:** [date]
**Valid until:** [estimate - 30 days for stable, 7 for fast-moving]
```

## Source Hierarchy

| Level | Sources | Use |
|-------|---------|-----|
| HIGH | Context7, official documentation | State as fact |
| MEDIUM | WebSearch verified with official source | State with attribution |
| LOW | WebSearch only, single source | Flag for validation |

## Verification Pitfalls

### Configuration Scope Blindness
**Trap:** Assuming global configuration means no project-scoping exists
**Prevention:** Verify ALL configuration scopes (global, project, local)

### Deprecated Features
**Trap:** Finding old documentation and concluding feature doesn't exist
**Prevention:** Check current official docs, review changelog

### Negative Claims Without Evidence
**Trap:** Making "X is not possible" statements without official verification
**Prevention:** For negative claims, require explicit official documentation

### Single Source Reliance
**Trap:** Relying on single source for critical claims
**Prevention:** Require multiple sources for critical claims
