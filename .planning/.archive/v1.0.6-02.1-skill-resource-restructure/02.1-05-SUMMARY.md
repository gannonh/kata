# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 02.1-04
    provides: cleaned up build.js to copy only source directories
provides:
  - Minimal kata/ directory (bin/ and VERSION only)
  - Skills fully self-contained with local references
affects: [future-phases, npx-distribution]

# Phase 02.1 Plan 05: Remove Shared Kata Directories Summary

**Removed shared kata/references/, kata/templates/, and kata/workflows/ directories - skills are now fully self-contained**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-24T21:40:04Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-24T21:41:48Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files deleted:** 53

## Accomplishments

- Verified no remaining @~/.claude/kata/ references in source files (skills/, agents/, commands/)
- Removed kata/references/ (9 files), kata/templates/ (22+ files), kata/workflows/ (12 files)
- Preserved kata/bin/ and kata/VERSION for npx distribution
- Verified skills still have their bundled local resources
- Confirmed build still succeeds with clean kata/ directory

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Final verification of no kata/ references** - (verification only, no commit)
2. **Task 2: Remove shared kata/ resource directories** - `6780d71` (refactor)
3. **Task 3: Verify skills still work with local resources** - (verification only, no commit)

- checkpoints.md, continuation-format.md, git-integration.md, model-profiles.md
- planning-config.md, questioning.md, tdd.md, ui-brand.md, verification-patterns.md

## Decisions Made

None - followed plan as specified.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Phase Readiness
