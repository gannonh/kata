### Batch 2: Settings

| # | Scenario | Status | Evidence |
|---|----------|--------|----------|
| S3 | Configure settings shows worktree toggle (PR workflow enabled) | Pending | |

### Batch 3: Phase Execution

| # | Scenario | Status | Evidence |
|---|----------|--------|----------|
| S4 | Phase execution creates plan worktree | Pending | |
| S5 | Executor works inside plan worktree | Pending | |
| S6 | Worktree merges back to main after execution | Pending | |

### Batch 4: Milestone Completion

## Gaps Found

| # | Area | Description | Severity | Fixed |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| G1 | setup-worktrees.sh | Hardcoded `main` branch name; fails with `master` default | Bug | Yes |
| G2 | setup-worktrees.sh | Bare clone overwrites remote URL with local path | Bug | Yes |
| G3 | kata-new-project | `git init` without `-b main` defaults to system setting | Bug | Yes |
| G4 | kata-new-project | Script path uses absolute form instead of sibling-relative | Bug | Yes |
| G5 | kata-new-project | Missing `cd main` after worktree setup | Bug | Yes |
| G6 | setup-worktrees.sh | Bare clone doesn't preserve branch upstream tracking | Bug | Yes |
| G7 | setup-worktrees.sh | No post-setup messaging about working from `main/` | UX | Yes |
| G8 | setup-worktrees.sh | No README at project root explaining layout | UX | Yes |
| G9 | kata-configure-settings | No messaging when toggling worktrees off | UX | Yes |
| G10 | kata-configure-settings | Config writes dirty working tree before setup-worktrees.sh | Bug | Yes |
| G11 | setup-worktrees.sh | No detection of running inside existing worktree; causes recursive conversion | Bug | Yes |
| G12 | kata-doctor | `check-config.sh` flags `worktree.enabled` as unknown key | Gap | No |
| G13 | kata-plan-phase | grep pipeline exits 1 during phase description extraction despite producing correct output | Gap | No |
