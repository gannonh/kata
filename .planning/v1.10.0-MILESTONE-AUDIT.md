**Score: 4/4 flows complete**

## Tech Debt

### Phase 44 + 47: Missing VERIFICATION.md
Phases 44 and 47 lack formal VERIFICATION.md files. Verification data exists in plan SUMMARYs. Process gap, not a functional gap.

### Phase 48: Test Exclusions
- **create-draft-pr.sh** excluded from testing. Requires gh CLI and GitHub remote. Documented in plan and summary.
- **manage-worktree.sh merge** subcommand excluded from testing. Requires real git checkout/merge operations that are slow and fragile in temp repos.

### Documentation
- `planning-config.md` lacks a worktree.enabled usage example in the Reading Config section.

**Total: 5 items across 4 categories. All non-blocking.**

## Test Results

- 47 script tests passing across 6 test files
- 44 plugin tests passing
- Build succeeds (`npm run build:plugin`)
- Execution time under 2 seconds for script tests
