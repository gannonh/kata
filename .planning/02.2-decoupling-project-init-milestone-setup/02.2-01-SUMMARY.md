# Phase 02.2 Plan 01: Reduce starting-projects Scope Summary

**One-liner:** starting-projects reduced to project configuration only (PROJECT.md + config.json), with add-milestone prompt

## What Was Built

Reduced the scope of `kata-starting-projects` from a monolithic 10-phase flow to a focused 6-phase flow that handles only project initialization:

**Before:**
- Phase 1-5.5: Setup, brownfield detection, questioning, PROJECT.md, config.json, model profile
- Phase 6-8: Research, requirements, roadmap creation (now removed)
- Phase 10: Done with full artifact list (replaced)

**After:**
- Phase 1-5.5: Same (setup, brownfield, questioning, PROJECT.md, config.json, model profile)
- Phase 6: New Done phase with reduced completion banner pointing to `/kata:add-milestone`

## Key Changes

| Section | Before | After |
| ------- | ------ | ----- |
| Objective "Creates:" | 6 artifacts (PROJECT.md, config.json, research/, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md) | 2 artifacts (PROJECT.md, config.json) |
| Objective "After:" | "Run `/kata:plan-phase 1`" | "Run `/kata:add-milestone`" |
| Output section | 6 artifacts listed | 2 artifacts listed |
| Success criteria | 17 items including roadmap/requirements | 7 items for project config only |
| execution_context | Included requirements-template.md | Removed requirements-template.md |
| Phase 6-8 | Research, requirements, roadmap phases | Removed entirely |
| Phase 10 | Full artifact completion banner | New Phase 6 with reduced banner |

## Files Changed

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification Results

All verification checks passed:

```
Phase 6: Research Decision count: 0 (removed)
Phase 7: Define Requirements count: 0 (removed)
Phase 8: Create Roadmap count: 0 (removed)
add-milestone references count: 3 (objective, phase 6, next up)
ROADMAP in Creates section: 0 (removed)
```

## Next Plan Readiness

- [ ] Plan 02.2-02 depends on this to create kata-adding-milestones with the moved research/requirements/roadmap phases
- [ ] The research, requirements, and roadmap flows from the removed phases need to be incorporated into the new skill
