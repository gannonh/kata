# Phase 02.2 Plan 04: Documentation Updates Summary

**One-liner:** Updated CLAUDE.md skills table to reflect starting-milestones -> adding-milestones rename, adjusted starting-projects tests, and marked related todo as complete.

## What Was Built

Final cleanup for the project init / milestone decoupling phase:

1. **CLAUDE.md skills table** - Changed `kata-starting-milestones` to `kata-adding-milestones` with updated invocation and purpose
2. **starting-projects test** - Updated expectations to reflect reduced scope (only PROJECT.md + config.json, not ROADMAP/STATE)
3. **Todo marked done** - Moved `2026-01-18-separate-new-project-from-first-milestone.md` from pending to done with completion note

## must_haves Verification

| Truth/Artifact | Status | Notes |
| -------------- | ------ | ----- |
| CLAUDE.md reflects renamed skill | PASS | `kata-adding-milestones` in skills table |
| starting-projects test expects reduced output | PASS | No ROADMAP.md expectation |
| Todo marked as done | PASS | Moved to `.planning/todos/done/` |
| CLAUDE.md contains `kata-adding-milestones` | PASS | Skills table updated |
| Completed todo exists | PASS | With resolution section |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Commits

| Hash | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| 31f4343 | docs | update documentation for skill rename |

## Files

| File | Action | Purpose |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| CLAUDE.md | Modified | Skills table update: starting-milestones -> adding-milestones |
| tests/skills/starting-projects.test.js | Modified | Adjusted expectations for reduced scope |
| .planning/todos/done/2026-01-18-separate-new-project-from-first-milestone.md | Modified | Moved from pending, added resolution note |

## Phase 02.2 Complete

This plan completes Phase 02.2: Decouple Project Init & Milestone Setup.

**What the phase accomplished:**
- Plan 01: Reduced `kata-starting-projects` scope to PROJECT.md + config.json only
- Plan 02: Created `kata-adding-milestones` skill with research/requirements/roadmap flow
- Plan 03: Deleted old `kata-starting-milestones` directory, renamed tests
- Plan 04: Updated documentation and marked todo complete

**New mental model:**
```
project (PROJECT.md + config) -> milestone (REQUIREMENTS.md + ROADMAP.md) -> phases -> plans
```

**User workflow:**
1. `/kata:new-project` - Creates PROJECT.md and config.json
2. `/kata:add-milestone` - Research, requirements, roadmap for a deliverable
3. `/kata:plan-phase` - Break milestone phase into plans
4. `/kata:execute` - Execute plans

## Verification

```bash
# No starting-milestones in CLAUDE.md
grep -c "starting-milestones" CLAUDE.md  # 0

# adding-milestones present
grep -c "adding-milestones" CLAUDE.md  # >= 1

# Todo completed
ls .planning/todos/done/2026-01-18-separate-new-project-from-first-milestone.md  # exists
```

All verification checks pass. Human checkpoint verified.
