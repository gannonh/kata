# Phase 02.2 Plan 03: Delete starting-milestones and Update Tests Summary

**One-liner:** Deleted kata-starting-milestones skill directory and renamed test file to adding-milestones.test.js with updated references.

## What Was Built

Completed the skill rename cleanup:

1. **Deleted skill directory** - Removed `skills/kata-starting-milestones/` entirely (5 files)
2. **Renamed test file** - `tests/skills/starting-milestones.test.js` -> `tests/skills/adding-milestones.test.js`
3. **Updated test content**:
   - describe block: `kata-starting-milestones` -> `kata-adding-milestones`
   - skillSource path: `kata-starting-milestones` -> `kata-adding-milestones`
   - skillDest path: `kata-starting-milestones` -> `kata-adding-milestones`
   - Test prompts: "start milestone" -> "add milestone"
   - Static content test path: `kata-starting-milestones` -> `kata-adding-milestones`

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Commits

| Hash | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| bd93de0 | refactor | delete starting-milestones, rename tests |

## Files

| File | Action | Purpose |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| skills/kata-starting-milestones/ | Deleted | Removed old skill (replaced by kata-adding-milestones) |
| tests/skills/starting-milestones.test.js | Deleted | Old test file |
| tests/skills/adding-milestones.test.js | Created (rename) | Test suite for kata-adding-milestones |

## Next Phase Readiness

Ready for 02.2-04:
- No "starting-milestones" references remain in skills/ or tests/
- kata-adding-milestones skill exists (from 02.2-02)
- Tests target the correct skill
- Can now reduce kata-starting-projects scope in plan 04

## Verification

```bash
# No starting-milestones in skills/
find skills/ -name "*starting-milestones*" | wc -l  # 0

# adding-milestones exists
ls skills/kata-adding-milestones/SKILL.md  # exists

# Test file renamed
ls tests/skills/adding-milestones.test.js  # exists

# No starting-milestones in test file
grep -c "starting-milestones" tests/skills/adding-milestones.test.js  # 0
```

All verification checks pass.
