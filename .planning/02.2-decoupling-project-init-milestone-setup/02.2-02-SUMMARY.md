# Phase 02.2 Plan 02: Create kata-adding-milestones Skill Summary

**One-liner:** Renamed kata-starting-milestones to kata-adding-milestones for skill naming consistency, preserving GitHub Milestone creation and research-requirements-roadmap flow.

## What Was Built

Created new `skills/kata-adding-milestones/` skill directory by renaming from `kata-starting-milestones`:

1. **SKILL.md** - Updated frontmatter:
   - `name: kata-adding-milestones`
   - `user-invocable: true` (was false)
   - Description triggers: "add milestone", "first milestone", "new milestone", etc.
   - User command: `/kata:add-milestone`

2. **Objective clarified** - Works for both:
   - First milestone (after /kata:new-project)
   - Subsequent milestones (after completing a milestone)

3. **Reference files copied**:
   - questioning.md
   - ui-brand.md
   - project-template.md
   - requirements-template.md

4. **New reference: github-mapping.md** - Documents Kata-GitHub primitive mapping:
   - Milestone -> GitHub Milestone (1:1, via add-milestone Phase 5.5)
   - Phase -> GitHub Issue (future, planning-phases)
   - Plan -> Checklist items (future, executing-phases)
   - Task -> N/A (internal only)

## Key Features Preserved

- **Phase 5.5**: GitHub Milestone creation when `github.enabled=true` and remote exists
- **Remote validation**: Check for GitHub remote before auth check
- **Research flow**: Phases 7-9 (optional research -> requirements -> roadmap)
- **Model profile resolution**: Phase 6.5 model lookup table
- **Idempotent creation**: Check if milestone exists before creating

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Phase Readiness

Ready for 02.2-03:
- kata-adding-milestones skill exists with full milestone flow
- GitHub Milestone creation preserved (Phase 5.5)
- Can now reduce kata-starting-projects scope in plan 03

## Verification

```bash
# Skill exists
ls -la skills/kata-adding-milestones/

# Name correct
grep "^name: kata-adding-milestones" skills/kata-adding-milestones/SKILL.md

# Triggers present
grep -i "add milestone" skills/kata-adding-milestones/SKILL.md

# Phase 5.5 preserved
grep "Phase 5.5" skills/kata-adding-milestones/SKILL.md

# GitHub mapping reference
head -5 skills/kata-adding-milestones/references/github-mapping.md
```

All verification checks pass.
