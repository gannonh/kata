# Milestone v1.4.1: Issue Execution

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-03
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

Complete the issue lifecycle with execution workflows, PR integration with auto-closure, roadmap integration, and plan-phase issue context wiring.

## Phases

### Phase 1: PR → Issue Closure

**Goal**: All PR-creating workflows properly close their associated GitHub Issues.
**Requirements:** CLOSE-01, CLOSE-02, CLOSE-03
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Verify execute-phase, implement complete-milestone closure, document pattern

**Details:**
- Verified CLOSE-01 (execute-phase already implements `Closes #X`)
- Implemented CLOSE-02 (multi-issue `Closes #X` in milestone PRs)
- Documented CLOSE-03 pattern for issue execution PRs

### Phase 2: Issue Execution Workflow

**Goal**: Structured execution path when working on an issue.
**Requirements:** EXEC-01, EXEC-02, EXEC-03
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Mode selection + quick task enhancement (EXEC-01, EXEC-02)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Planned mode routing (EXEC-03)

**Details:**
- "Work on it now" offers mode selection (quick task vs planned)
- Quick task creates plan, executes, creates PR with `Closes #X`
- Planned mode routes to phase creation or existing phase linkage

### Phase 3: Issue → Roadmap Integration

**Goal**: Pull backlog issues into milestones and phases.
**Requirements:** INTEG-01, INTEG-02, INTEG-03
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Issue selection in add-milestone + complete phase linkage (INTEG-01, INTEG-02)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — source_issue traceability in plans (INTEG-03)

**Details:**
- Milestone scope definition includes backlog issue selection
- Phase linkage with bidirectional tracking (issue frontmatter + STATE.md)
- source_issue field in PLAN.md for traceability

### Phase 4: Wire plan-phase to Issue Context

**Goal**: Connect plan-phase to STATE.md issue sections so source_issue is set in generated plans.
**Requirements:** INTEG-03 (gap closure)
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Wire plan-phase to STATE.md issue sections

**Details:**
- plan-phase extracts linked issues from STATE.md sections
- Issue context passed to kata-planner when linked issues exist
- Generated PLAN.md files include source_issue when created from linked issues

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- INTEG-03 closed — plan-phase extracts issue context from STATE.md for kata-planner
- v1.4.1 inserted — Continue issue work before phase management
- Commands deprecated — Skills are user-invocable directly via /kata-skill-name

**Issues Resolved:**
- Complete issue lifecycle from creation to PR auto-closure
- Source issue traceability chain (issue → plan → PR → closure)
- Bidirectional issue-phase linkage

**Issues Deferred:**
- Phase organization (state directories) — deferred to v1.5.0
- Phase movement between milestones — deferred to v1.5.0
- Roadmap format enhancements — deferred to v1.5.0

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Milestone audit status was `tech_debt` (accepted to ship)
