## v1.4.0 Requirements

### Issue Model (Shipped)

- [x] **ISS-01**: Rename "todos" vocabulary to "issues" throughout Kata (skills, UI messages, file references)
- [x] **ISS-02**: Store issues as GitHub Issues with `backlog` label when `github.enabled=true`
- [x] **ISS-03**: Keep local `.planning/issues/` fallback for non-GitHub projects
- [x] **ISS-04**: Display issues in `/kata:check-issues` (renamed from check-todos) with unified view across local and GitHub sources

### Pull from GitHub (Shipped)

- [x] **PULL-01**: Pull existing GitHub Issues into Kata workflow (query via `gh issue list`, filter by labels, make workable)
- [x] **PULL-02**: Link Kata execution to external GitHub Issues (reference existing issues during phase execution, auto-update on completion)

### Phase Management (Deferred to v1.5.0)

- [ ] **PHASE-01**: Organize phase folders into state directories: `pending/`, `active/`, `completed/`
- [ ] **PHASE-02**: Move phases between milestones via `/kata:move-phase` skill
- [ ] **PHASE-03**: Reorder phases within a milestone with automatic renumbering of subsequent phases
- [ ] **PHASE-04**: Reset phase numbering at milestone boundaries (each milestone starts at phase 1, not cumulative)
- [ ] **PHASE-05**: Validate phase artifacts at completion (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md existence; VERIFICATION.md for non-gap phases)

### Roadmap Improvements (Deferred to v1.5.0)

- [ ] **ROAD-01**: Show future milestones in ROADMAP.md (currently only shows current milestone)
- [ ] **ROAD-02**: Improve roadmap format for readability (clearer phase/milestone hierarchy, better progress indicators)
