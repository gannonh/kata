# Milestone v1.3.0: Release Automation

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-28
**Phases:** 0-1
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

Harden CI validation and automate the release pipeline. CI validates plugin artifacts before creating GitHub Release, and users can trigger release workflow from milestone completion with version detection, changelog generation, and dry-run preview.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation & CI Hardening

**Goal**: CI validates actual plugin artifacts to prevent path resolution failures
**Depends on**: None (foundation)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 00-01: Create artifact validation test suite
- [x] 00-02: Reorder CI workflow for pre-release validation

**Success Criteria:**
1. CI tests actual plugin artifacts from `dist/plugin/` directory
2. Integration test suite validates transformed paths
3. Artifact verification runs in CI before creating GitHub Release
4. Test coverage includes @./references/ path resolution
5. Build failures block release creation

### Phase 1: Release Automation

**Goal**: Users can trigger release workflow from milestone completion (milestone → PR merge → GitHub Release → CI publish)
**Depends on**: Phase 0 complete
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Create version detection and changelog generation references
- [x] 01-02: Integrate release workflow into completing-milestones skill

**Success Criteria:**
1. Auto-generate changelog from conventional commits (REL-01)
2. Auto-detect semantic version bump (REL-02)
3. Trigger release from milestone completion (REL-03)
4. Dry-run release validation (REL-04)
5. Version bump updates plugin.json
6. Review gate before publish

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Pure bash functions for version detection and changelog generation (no external dependencies)
- jq for reliable JSON manipulation in version files
- Review gate mandatory for changelog (human approval before write)
- CI workflow reorder: tests → build → validate → release

**Issues Resolved:**
- v1.0.3-1.0.8 path resolution issues prevented by artifact validation gates
- Release breakage prevented by pre-release validation

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
