# Milestone v1.7.0: Brainstorm Integration

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-07
**Goal:** Ship the kata-brainstorm skill and integrate structured brainstorming as an optional step across Kata workflows.
**Phases:** 35-36
**Total Plans:** 5

## Overview

v1.7.0 ships structured explorer/challenger brainstorming via Agent Teams and wires it into existing Kata workflows as an optional step. Brainstorm output feeds into downstream planner and researcher agents as context.

## Phases

### Phase 35: Ship Brainstorm Skill

**Goal**: kata-brainstorm skill works standalone with Agent Teams prerequisite handling and project context injection.
**Depends on**: None
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 35-01: Prerequisite check and API updates
- [x] 35-02: Kata-aware context injection

**Details:**
- Added Step 0 Agent Teams prerequisite gate (env var check, settings.json fallback, read-merge-write enable)
- Replaced generic context gathering with Kata-specific artifact assembly (~1300 word brief from 4 sources)
- TeamCreate/TeamDelete API references replace deprecated Teammate calls

### Phase 36: Workflow Integration

**Goal**: Existing Kata workflows offer brainstorm as an optional step at natural decision points, and brainstorm output feeds downstream agents.
**Depends on**: Phase 35
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 36-01: Add brainstorm gates to add-milestone, new-project, discuss-phase
- [x] 36-02: Add brainstorm gates to research-phase and plan-phase
- [x] 36-03: Wire brainstorm SUMMARY.md into planner and researcher context

**Details:**
- 5 workflow integration points using consistent AskUserQuestion gate pattern
- Half-step numbering (1.5, 3.5, 2.5) avoids renumbering existing steps
- Brainstorm SUMMARY.md discovered via `ls -dt` pattern, injected into planner/researcher prompts
- All gates non-blocking (skip continues parent workflow)

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**
- Decision: Half-step numbering for brainstorm gates (Rationale: Avoids renumbering existing workflow steps)
- Decision: Sub-skill delegation for prerequisite check (Rationale: Brainstorm skill owns its own Agent Teams check)
- Decision: `ls -dt` discovery pattern for brainstorm output (Rationale: Finds most recent session without path hardcoding)
- Decision: Two-path context assembly (Rationale: Kata projects get rich context, non-Kata falls back to generic)

**Issues Resolved:**
- GitHub #99: Integrate explorer/challenger brainstorming skill into Kata

**Issues Deferred:** None

**Technical Debt Incurred:** None
