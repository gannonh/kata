# Requirements Archive: v1.5.0 Phase Management

**Archived:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED

This is the archived requirements specification for v1.5.0.
For current requirements, see `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (created for next milestone).

---

## Phase Organization

- [x] **PHASE-01**: Phase directories are organized under `pending/`, `active/`, `completed/` subdirectories
- [x] **PHASE-05**: Phase completion validates PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md exist; non-gap phases require VERIFICATION.md

## Phase Movement

- [x] **PHASE-02**: User can move a phase to a different milestone via `/kata:kata-move-phase`
- [x] **PHASE-03**: User can reorder phases within a milestone with automatic renumbering
- [x] **PHASE-04**: Each milestone starts phase numbering at 1 (not cumulative across milestones)

## Roadmap

- [x] **ROAD-01**: ROADMAP.md displays future planned milestones (not just current)
- [x] **ROAD-02**: Phase and milestone hierarchy is visually clear with consistent formatting and scannable progress indicators

## Future Requirements

None deferred.

## Out of Scope

- Phase dependencies (blocking relationships between phases) — later milestone
- Phase templates (reusable phase patterns) — later milestone
- Cross-project phase sharing — not building
