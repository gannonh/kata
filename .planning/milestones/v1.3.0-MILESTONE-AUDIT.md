### E2E Flow Verification

#### Flow 1: Complete Milestone with Release

```
/kata:complete-milestone
    ↓
Step 0.5: Offer release workflow (AskUserQuestion)
    ↓
Version detection (version-detector.md)
    ↓
Changelog generation (changelog-generator.md)
    ↓
User confirmation (AskUserQuestion)
    ↓
Update files (package.json, plugin.json, CHANGELOG.md)
    ↓
Commit changes
    ↓
Create PR (if pr_workflow=true) or direct push
    ↓
PR merge triggers CI
    ↓
CI validates artifacts (npm run test:artifacts)
    ↓
CI creates GitHub Release
    ↓
CI publishes to marketplace
```

**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE (all steps verified)

#### Flow 2: Dry-Run Release Preview

```
/kata:complete-milestone
    ↓
Step 0.5: Select "Yes, dry-run first"
    ↓
Version detection (preview only)
    ↓
Changelog generation (preview only)
    ↓
Display preview (no file changes)
    ↓
"DRY RUN COMPLETE" message
    ↓
Return to main flow (no release artifacts created)
```

**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE (dry-run properly prevents all writes)

## Gaps Summary

**Critical gaps:** None
**Non-critical gaps:** None
**Tech debt:** None
