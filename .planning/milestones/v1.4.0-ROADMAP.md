# Milestone Archive: v1.4.0 GitHub Issue Sync

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED
**Phases:** 1-2 (11 plans total)
**Shipped:** 2026-02-01

## Milestone Overview

**Goal:** Unified issue model and bidirectional GitHub Issue integration.

This milestone established "issues" as Kata's primary vocabulary (replacing "todos") and integrated with GitHub Issues for a seamless bidirectional workflow.

---

## Phase 1: Issue Model Foundation

**Goal:** Establish "issues" as Kata's vocabulary with local storage and unified display.
**Requirements:** ISS-01, ISS-03, ISS-04
**Plans:** 6 plans

- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Rename adding-todos to adding-issues
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Rename checking-todos to checking-issues
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Add auto-migration logic
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Update secondary skill references
- [x] 01-05-PLAN.md — Deprecation handling
- [x] 01-06-PLAN.md — STATE.md integration verification

**Success Criteria** (verified):
1. ✅ All Kata skills, agents, and UI messages use "issues" instead of "todos"
2. ✅ User can create issues that persist to `.planning/issues/` in non-GitHub projects
3. ✅ `/kata:check-issues` displays all issues with consistent format regardless of source

**Status:** COMPLETE (2026-01-31)

## Phase 2: GitHub Issue Sync

**Goal:** Integrate Kata issues with GitHub Issues for bidirectional workflow.
**Requirements:** ISS-02, PULL-01, PULL-02
**Dependencies:** Phase 1
**Plans:** 5 plans (3 core + 2 gap closure)

- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Add GitHub Issue sync to add-issue skill
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Add GitHub Issue pull to check-issues skill
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Add execution linking (auto-close on completion)
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Gap: Add in-progress label sync
- [x] 02-05-PLAN.md — Gap: Add self-assignment on work start

**Success Criteria** (verified):
1. ✅ Issues created in Kata appear as GitHub Issues with `backlog` label when `github.enabled=true`
2. ✅ User can pull existing GitHub Issues into Kata workflow via filtering
3. ✅ Kata execution can reference and auto-update external GitHub Issues on completion

**Status:** COMPLETE (2026-02-01)

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Unified "issues" vocabulary** — Renamed all "todo" references to "issues" across skills, agents, and UI
2. **Bidirectional GitHub sync** — Issues created in Kata automatically sync to GitHub with `backlog` label
3. **GitHub Issue pull** — Users can pull existing GitHub Issues into Kata workflow
4. **Execution linking** — Auto-close GitHub Issues on completion
5. **In-progress label sync** — Adds `in-progress` label when starting work
6. **Self-assignment** — Auto-assigns GitHub Issue to `@me` when starting work
