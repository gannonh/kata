# Milestone v1.5.0: Phase Management

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-04
**Goal:** Improved phase organization, movement, and roadmap visibility.
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

v1.5.0 delivers phase management capabilities: organized state directories for phase artifacts, cross-milestone phase movement with automatic renumbering, and improved roadmap formatting with future milestone visibility.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Phase Organization

**Goal**: Organize phase artifacts into state directories with completion validation.
**Depends on**: None
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 01-01: Universal phase discovery pattern and state transitions in core orchestrators
- [x] 01-02: Propagate universal phase discovery to all remaining skills, agents, and docs

**Details:**
Introduced `pending/`, `active/`, `completed/` subdirectories under `.planning/phases/`. All skills and agents updated with universal discovery pattern using `find` instead of `ls` glob patterns for zsh compatibility. State transitions handled automatically by phase execution and completion workflows. Backward-compatible with flat phase directories.

### Phase 2: Phase Movement

**Goal**: Enable flexible phase reorganization within and across milestones.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 02-01: Create kata-move-phase skill for cross-milestone moves with per-milestone numbering
- [x] 02-02: Add within-milestone reorder capability, help listing, and requirements traceability

**Details:**
Created `/kata:kata-move-phase` skill supporting cross-milestone moves and within-milestone reordering. Enforced per-milestone phase numbering starting at 1 (independent, not cumulative). Updated help listing and requirements traceability table.

### Phase 3: Roadmap Enhancements

**Goal**: Improve roadmap visibility and readability.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 03-01: Standardize completed milestone details blocks and add Planned Milestones section
- [x] 03-02: Propagate format conventions to milestone completion, add-milestone, and roadmapper agents

**Details:**
Standardized ROADMAP.md formatting: consistent `<details>` blocks for completed milestones with Goal lines and archive links, Planned Milestones section with placeholder future milestones, expanded Progress Summary table. Propagated conventions to kata-complete-milestone, kata-add-milestone, and kata-roadmapper.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

None.

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Universal `find`-based discovery pattern (Rationale: zsh-safe, supports both flat and state directories)
- Decision: Per-milestone phase numbering at 1 (Rationale: Independent numbering avoids cross-milestone confusion)
- Decision: Planned Milestones section in ROADMAP.md (Rationale: Future visibility without cluttering active work)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Fixed zsh glob expansion failures with `ls -d` patterns across all skills and agents
- Fixed directory creation ordering in new-project skill

**Issues Deferred:**

None.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None. Phases 1-2 directories (01-phase-organization, 02-phase-movement) remain in flat format (pre-state-directory). Only Phase 3 used the new `completed/` directory.
