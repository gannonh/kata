# v1.6.0 Milestone Audit: Skills-Native Subagents

**Milestone Goal:** Deprecate custom subagent types to make Kata portable across Agent Skills-compatible platforms.

**Audit Date:** 2026-02-06
**Test Suite:** 44/44 passing
**Build:** Clean (`npm run build:plugin` succeeds)

**Score: 15/15 implemented requirements satisfied**

Note: TEAM-01 through TEAM-06 (Agent Teams Migration) are defined in REQUIREMENTS.md but were deferred. They remain pending for a future milestone.

## Phase Verification

| Phase | Name                        | Plans | Verification Status | Score |

| 34    | Cleanup                     | 2     | Passed              | 4/4   |

**Score: 5/5 phases verified**

## Integration Check

| Area                        | Checked | Issues | Status |
|-----------------------------|---------|--------|--------|
| Skill-to-reference wiring   | 11 skills | 0    | Pass   |
| Cross-skill sharing         | 6 shared files | 0 | Pass  |
| Custom subagent elimination | All skills | 0   | Pass   |
| Build output integrity      | dist/plugin/ | 0  | Pass   |
| Reference file wiring       | 3 workflow files | 0 | Pass |
| Documentation consistency   | 3 docs  | 0      | Pass   |
| E2E flow completeness       | 3 flows | 0      | Pass   |

**Score: 7/7 integration areas passing**

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Plan Phase | researcher → planner → plan-checker (all general-purpose with inlined instructions) | Complete |
| Execute Phase | executor (wave-parallel) → test suite → verifier (all general-purpose) | Complete |
| Verify Work | verifier → debugger → planner → plan-checker (gap closure loop) | Complete |

**Score: 3/3 flows verified**

## Tech Debt

### Phase 33: skills.sh Distribution (non-blocking)

1. **CI publish untested** — The CI pipeline has skills-sh build and push steps, but they haven't executed yet because no version bump has triggered them. Will be verified when v1.6.0 ships.
2. **Install command unverified** — `npx skills add gannonh/kata-skills` cannot be tested until the repo is populated by CI.
3. **SKILLS_TOKEN secret** — Assumed configured based on user confirmation during Phase 33 execution.

### Deferred Requirements (informational)

TEAM-01 through TEAM-06 define an Agent Teams Migration pattern (converting subagent spawning to team-based coordination with shared task lists). These remain in REQUIREMENTS.md as pending. They were not scheduled into any phase for v1.6.0 and represent future work.

### Bug Found During Audit (fixed)

`kata-execute-phase/SKILL.md` line 58 used a hardcoded relative path `skills/kata-execute-phase/scripts/find-phase.sh` that breaks when the target project has its own `skills/` directory. Fixed to use `${SKILL_BASE_DIR}/scripts/find-phase.sh`.

## Conclusion

v1.6.0 achieved its primary goal: Kata is now portable across Agent Skills-compatible platforms. All custom `kata:kata-*` subagent types eliminated. 19 agent instruction files migrated to skill resources with automated validation. Documentation updated. Build clean.

The 3 blocked items in Phase 33 are expected — they depend on the release trigger and carry low risk since the CI implementation mirrors the proven marketplace publish pattern.
