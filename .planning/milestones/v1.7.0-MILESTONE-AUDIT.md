# Milestone Audit: v1.7.0 Brainstorm Integration

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| SKILL-01 | kata-brainstorm included in plugin build | 35 | satisfied |
| SKILL-02 | Skill invokes correctly via `/kata-brainstorm` | 35 | satisfied |
| SKILL-03 | Output written to `.planning/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-brainstorm/` | 35 | satisfied |
| PREREQ-01 | Checks CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS before spawning | 35 | satisfied |
| PREREQ-02 | Offers to enable Agent Teams via settings.json merge | 35 | satisfied |
| PREREQ-03 | Skips gracefully on decline | 35 | satisfied |
| WFLOW-01 | kata-add-milestone offers brainstorm gate | 36 | satisfied |
| WFLOW-02 | kata-plan-phase offers brainstorm gate | 36 | satisfied |
| WFLOW-03 | kata-new-project offers brainstorm gate | 36 | satisfied |
| WFLOW-04 | kata-discuss-phase offers brainstorm gate | 36 | satisfied |
| WFLOW-05 | kata-research-phase offers brainstorm follow-up | 36 | satisfied |
| CTX-01 | Brainstorm agents receive condensed project brief | 35 | satisfied |
| CTX-02 | Brainstorm output auto-feeds downstream agents | 36 | satisfied |

**Score: 13/13 requirements satisfied**

## Phase Verification

| Phase | Name | Plans | Verification | Status |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 35 | Ship Brainstorm Skill | 2/2 | 16/16 must-haves | passed |
| 36 | Workflow Integration | 3/3 | 12/12 must-haves, 6/6 links | passed |

**Score: 2/2 phases verified**

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Connection | From | To | Status |
|-----------|------|----|--------|
| Gate invokes skill | kata-add-milestone | /kata-brainstorm | connected |
| Gate invokes skill | kata-new-project | /kata-brainstorm | connected |
| Gate invokes skill | kata-discuss-phase | /kata-brainstorm | connected |
| Gate invokes skill | kata-research-phase | /kata-brainstorm | connected |
| Gate invokes skill | kata-plan-phase | /kata-brainstorm | connected |
| Context injection | brainstorm SUMMARY.md | planner + researcher agents | connected |

**Path consistency:** Writer outputs to `.planning/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-brainstorm/SUMMARY.md`. All readers use `ls -dt .planning/brainstorms/*/SUMMARY.md | head -1` with `2>/dev/null` for graceful degradation.

**Score: 6/6 integration points connected**

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Standalone brainstorm | Invoke → prereq check → context gather → team spawn → debate → synthesize → write output | complete |
| Workflow brainstorm | Gate prompt → accept → invoke skill → output written → continue parent workflow | complete |
| Context injection | Brainstorm output → planner/researcher reads latest SUMMARY.md → injects into agent prompt | complete |

**Score: 3/3 flows complete**

## Build Verification

All 8 modified source files match their dist/plugin/ counterparts exactly.

## Tech Debt
