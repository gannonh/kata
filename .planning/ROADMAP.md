## Planned Milestones

### v1.7.0 (Planned)

**Goal:** To be defined.

**Target features:**
- TBD

---

## Current Milestone: v1.6.0 Skills-Native Subagents

**Goal:** Deprecate custom subagent types to make Kata portable across Agent Skills-compatible platforms.

**Experimental:** Working on `feat/skills-subagents` branch. Merge if successful. If POC fails, milestone is abandoned.

### Phase 30: Proof of Concept ✓

**Goal:** Validate the subagent-as-skill-resource pattern with 2 agents

**Dependencies:** None

**Requirements:** POC-01, POC-02, POC-03, POC-04, POC-05, POC-06

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Migrate kata-planner to skill resource + update kata-plan-phase
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Migrate kata-executor to skill resource + update kata-execute-phase
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Validate POC behavior + Go/No-Go decision (Go)

**Success Criteria:**
1. kata-planner instructions exist as skill resource (`skills/kata-plan-phase/references/planner-instructions.md`)
2. kata-executor instructions exist as skill resource (`skills/kata-execute-phase/references/executor-instructions.md`)
3. `kata-plan-phase` skill spawns standard `general-purpose` subagent with inlined instructions
4. `kata-execute-phase` skill spawns standard `general-purpose` subagent with inlined instructions
5. Phase planning produces equivalent quality output compared to current custom subagent pattern
6. User has made Go/No-Go decision (POC-06 is blocking gate)

**Note:** POC-06 is a human decision checkpoint. If user decides "No-Go", milestone is abandoned.

---

### Phase 31: Full Conversion ✓

**Goal:** Migrate all remaining agents to skill resources

**Dependencies:** Phase 30 (Go decision required)

**Requirements:** CONV-01, CONV-02, CONV-03, CONV-04, CONV-05

**Plans:** 7 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Migrate phase-researcher + plan-checker to kata-plan-phase
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Migrate project-researcher + synthesizer + roadmapper to kata-add-milestone
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Extract 8 PR review agents to kata-review-pull-requests
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Migrate integration-checker to kata-audit-milestone
- [x] 02-05-PLAN.md — Migrate debugger to kata-debug + extract verifier/codebase-mapper + update quick-task
- [x] 02-06-PLAN.md — Update shared agent consumers and reference files across skills
- [x] 02-07-PLAN.md — Migration validation test (CONV-04) + test suite step (CONV-05)

**Success Criteria:**
1. All 15+ agent instruction files migrated to skill `references/` directories
2. All skills that spawn subagents use `general-purpose` type with inlined instructions
3. No remaining `subagent_type="kata:kata-*"` patterns in codebase
4. Automated migration validation test passes in `npm test`
5. Execute-phase orchestrator runs project test suite before verification

---

### Phase 32: Phase lookup ignores milestone scope causing collisions ✓

**Goal:** Revert to globally sequential phase numbering, rename all historical directories, and update numbering policy across all skills

**Dependencies:** Phase 31
**Issue:** Closes #102
**Plans:** 3 plans (2 waves)

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Batch-rename completed + pending phase directories to globally sequential numbers
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Update numbering policy and documentation across all skill files
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Update ROADMAP.md and STATE.md with new global phase numbers

**Success Criteria:**
1. Every phase directory has a globally unique sequential numeric prefix (no collisions)
2. All "start phase numbering at 1" policy references updated to "continue from highest + 1"
3. ROADMAP.md and STATE.md reflect new global phase numbers
4. Phase lookup pattern works correctly with unique prefixes (no code change needed)

---

### Phase 33: skills.sh Distribution Channel

**Goal:** Publish Kata skills to skills.sh via a `gannonh/kata-skills` GitHub repo, creating a second distribution channel alongside the existing Claude Code plugin marketplace

**Dependencies:** Phase 32

**Requirements:** DIST-01, DIST-02, DIST-03, DIST-04

**Plans:** 3 plans (3 waves)

Plans:
- [ ] 33-01-PLAN.md — Add skills-sh build target with frontmatter transformation + build tests
- [ ] 33-02-PLAN.md — Generate README/LICENSE + optimize descriptions for cross-platform discovery
- [ ] 33-03-PLAN.md — Extend CI/CD pipeline to publish to gannonh/kata-skills repo

**Success Criteria:**
1. `gannonh/kata-skills` GitHub repo exists with `skills/` directory containing all Kata skill folders
2. Build step produces skills.sh-compatible output (skill folders with spec-compliant SKILL.md frontmatter)
3. `npx skills add gannonh/kata-skills` installs Kata skills successfully
4. CI/CD pipeline publishes to `gannonh/kata-skills` on release
5. Skill naming and descriptions optimized for skills.sh discovery (cross-platform, not Claude Code-specific)

---

### Phase 34: Cleanup (Contingent)

**Goal:** Remove legacy infrastructure and update documentation

**Dependencies:** Phase 33

**Contingency:** Only execute if Phase 33 completes

**Requirements:** CLEAN-01, CLEAN-02, CLEAN-03, CLEAN-04

**Success Criteria:**
1. `agents/` directory deleted from repository
2. Build system no longer references or copies agent files
3. CLAUDE.md and KATA-STYLE.md reflect new skill resource and agent teams patterns
4. Full workflow (new-project to plan to execute to verify) works with built plugin
