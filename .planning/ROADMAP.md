## Planned Milestones

### v1.7.0 (Planned)

**Goal:** To be defined.

**Target features:**
- TBD

---

## Current Milestone: v1.6.0 Skills-Native Subagents

**Goal:** Deprecate custom subagent types to make Kata portable across Agent Skills-compatible platforms.

**Experimental:** Working on `feat/skills-subagents` branch. Merge if successful. If POC fails, milestone is abandoned.

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept ✓

**Goal:** Validate the subagent-as-skill-resource pattern with 2 agents

**Dependencies:** None

**Requirements:** POC-01, POC-02, POC-03, POC-04, POC-05, POC-06

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Migrate kata-planner to skill resource + update kata-plan-phase
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Migrate kata-executor to skill resource + update kata-execute-phase
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Validate POC behavior + Go/No-Go decision (Go)

**Success Criteria:**
1. kata-planner instructions exist as skill resource (`skills/kata-plan-phase/references/planner-instructions.md`)
2. kata-executor instructions exist as skill resource (`skills/kata-execute-phase/references/executor-instructions.md`)
3. `kata-plan-phase` skill spawns standard `general-purpose` subagent with inlined instructions
4. `kata-execute-phase` skill spawns standard `general-purpose` subagent with inlined instructions
5. Phase planning produces equivalent quality output compared to current custom subagent pattern
6. User has made Go/No-Go decision (POC-06 is blocking gate)

**Note:** POC-06 is a human decision checkpoint. If user decides "No-Go", milestone is abandoned.

---

### Phase 2: Full Conversion (Contingent)

**Goal:** Migrate all remaining agents to skill resources

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (Go decision required)

**Contingency:** Only execute if POC succeeds (user approves Go decision in Phase 1)

**Requirements:** CONV-01, CONV-02, CONV-03, CONV-04, CONV-05

**Success Criteria:**
1. All 15+ agent instruction files migrated to skill `references/` directories
2. All skills that spawn subagents use `general-purpose` type with inlined instructions
3. No remaining `subagent_type="kata:kata-*"` patterns in codebase
4. Automated migration validation test passes in `npm test`
5. Execute-phase orchestrator runs project test suite before verification

---

### Phase 3: Cleanup (Contingent)

**Goal:** Remove legacy infrastructure and update documentation

**Dependencies:** Phase 2

**Contingency:** Only execute if Phase 2 completes

**Requirements:** CLEAN-01, CLEAN-02, CLEAN-03, CLEAN-04

**Success Criteria:**
1. `agents/` directory deleted from repository
2. Build system no longer references or copies agent files
3. CLAUDE.md and KATA-STYLE.md reflect new skill resource pattern
4. Full workflow (new-project to plan to execute to verify) works with built plugin
