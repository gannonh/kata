## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- ~~Project initialized with extension/wrapper approach (not hard fork)~~ **SUPERSEDED**
- **2026-01-17: Hard fork decision** - Severing all ties from upstream GSD, full rebrand
- Build GitHub Integration first (Phases 1-6), then VS Code Adapter (Phase 7)
- "Adapter" = IDE-specific code (VS Code Adapter, Claude Code Adapter)
- "Integration" = external system connection (GitHub Integration, Linear Integration)
- Claude Code first (where GSD already runs), then port to VS Code
