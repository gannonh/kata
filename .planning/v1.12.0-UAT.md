# v1.12.0 Codebase Intelligence — UAT

## Internal Verification (Claude performed)

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `npm run build:plugin` | ✅ Pass | Plugin builds cleanly |
| `npm test` (44 tests) | ✅ Pass | 44/44 |
| `npm run test:scripts` (160 tests) | ✅ Pass | 160/160 |
| `detect-stale-intel.cjs` on this project | ✅ Pass | 0 stale files, 60 fresh |
| `check-conventions.cjs` on recent changes | ✅ Pass | 0 violations |
| `scan-codebase.cjs` invocation | ✅ Pass | 60 files indexed, camelCase detected |

## Deliverables Overview

**User-facing deliverables (user experiences through Kata commands):**

1. **Greenfield intel scaffolding** — `/kata-new-project` automatically creates `.planning/intel/` (CAP-01, ARCH-03)
2. **Execution intel scans** — `/kata-execute-phase` step 7.25 runs scans, detects staleness, checks conventions (CAP-02, MAINT-01, MAINT-02, MAINT-03)
3. **Brownfield mapping** — `/kata-map-codebase` generates `.planning/intel/` from code analysis (ARCH-01, ARCH-02)
4. **Planner context** — `/kata-plan-phase` planner receives `<codebase_intelligence>` in prompt (INTEG-01)
5. **Executor context** — `/kata-execute-phase` executor receives conventions in prompt (INTEG-02)

**Internal deliverables (verified above):**

- `scan-codebase.cjs` script (import/export extraction, naming detection)
- `detect-stale-intel.cjs` script (staleness detection via git)
- `check-conventions.cjs` script (convention enforcement)
- `scaffold-intel.cjs` script (greenfield init)
- `update-intel-summary.cjs` script (summary regeneration)

## UAT Batches

### Batch 1: Intel Artifacts Review (in this project)

**Status:** complete

| Scenario | Expected | Result | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| S1: .planning/intel/summary.md exists and is ~80-150 lines | 124 lines, contains Stack/Architecture/Conventions sections | ❌ FAIL | File exists and has correct schema, but content reflects January GSD-era architecture (commands/, agents/, gsd: prefix). Content is misleading and harmful to agents consuming it. |
| S2: .planning/intel/index.json is v2 with recent commit hash | v2, 60 files, hash from 2026-02-16 | ✅ PASS | |
| S3: .planning/intel/conventions.json shows camelCase naming | camelCase pattern, confidence >= 0.70 | ✅ PASS | |

### Batch 2: Greenfield New Project Test

**Status:** pending

| Scenario | Expected | Result | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| S4: /kata-new-project creates .planning/intel/ | Three files created with v2 schema, totalFiles==0 | pending | Requires test project |
| S5: First /kata-execute-phase populates intel | step 7.25 runs full scan, index.json shows >0 files | pending | Requires test project |
| S6: Planner context references codebase intelligence | Planner's conversation mentions codebase conventions | pending | Requires test project |

## Issues Found

### GAP-1: Stale brownfield summary.md not detected or refreshed

**Severity:** High
**Category:** flows (E2E experience — agents receive stale/misleading context)

**Scenario:** S1 (Batch 1)
**User report:** summary.md content references old GSD-era architecture (January 2026 mapping), not current Skills architecture. Agents consuming it would receive incorrect codebase conventions and architecture description.

**Root cause:**
- `update-intel-summary.cjs` intentionally guards against overwriting brownfield-generated summaries (by design — brownfield mapper produces richer docs)
- `detect-stale-intel.cjs` checks staleness of code-derived index entries only (per-file `lastIndexed` vs current commit)
- Neither mechanism detects when brownfield mapper docs themselves are stale relative to codebase evolution

**Impact:** When a brownfield project's codebase architecture changes significantly after `/kata-map-codebase` was run, the summary.md becomes misleading indefinitely. Agents receive stale architectural context.

**Gap in MAINT-02:** The requirement states "doc gardening triggers partial re-analysis of codebase docs when documented code areas change significantly." The implementation re-scans code → updates index.json/conventions.json (correct), but never triggers re-analysis of the brownfield mapper docs that generate summary.md.

**Fix approach:** Either (a) add brownfield doc staleness detection that warns when `.planning/codebase/` docs are older than X days or when key architecture files have changed since mapping, or (b) allow update-intel-summary.cjs to regenerate summary from current scan data even when brownfield docs exist (removing the guard), or (c) add a visible warning in summary.md with the analysis date so agents know to treat it with skepticism.
