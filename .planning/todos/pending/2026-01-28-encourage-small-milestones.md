## Problem

The milestone workflow skill doesn't provide guidance on milestone size. Users may create large, waterfall-style milestones that are harder to execute, verify, and iterate on. Smaller milestones lead to better outcomes: faster feedback loops, clearer scope, easier verification.

## Solution

Update the adding-milestones skill to:
1. Actively encourage users to scope milestones as small as possible
2. Include guidance text explaining why smaller is better (feedback loops, reduced risk, clearer verification)
3. Possibly add heuristics or questions during milestone creation that help users identify when a milestone could be split
