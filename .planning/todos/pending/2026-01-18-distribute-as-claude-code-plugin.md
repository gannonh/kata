title: Distribute Kata as Claude Code plugin for CC users
area: distribution
files: []
---

## Problem

Kata currently exists as a standalone CLI tool, but many potential users are already using Claude Code (CC). To reach these users and provide the best integration experience, we should distribute Kata as a Claude Code plugin that CC users can install directly.

This would enable:
- Seamless installation via Claude Code's plugin system
- Better integration with CC's existing workflows
- Access to Kata's project management features within CC environment
- Lower barrier to entry for CC users who want structured development

## Solution

TBD - Need to research:
- Claude Code plugin architecture and distribution model
- How to package Kata's commands, agents, and workflows as a CC plugin
- Whether to maintain both standalone CLI and CC plugin versions
- Installation and update mechanisms for CC plugins
