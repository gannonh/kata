## Problem

Currently phases are fixed to their milestone once created. Users may need to:
- Move phases between milestones (scope changes)
- Reorder phases within a milestone
- Groom backlog by deferring phases

## Solution

Add roadmap management capabilities:
- Move phase command/skill (`/kata:move-phase 3 to v1.4.0`)
- Backlog grooming workflow
- Phase reordering with automatic renumbering

## Context

Deferred from v1.3.0 milestone to keep scope focused on release automation.
