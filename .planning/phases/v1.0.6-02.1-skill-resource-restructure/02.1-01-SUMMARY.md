# Phase 02.1 Plan 01: Copy Resources Summary

**Copied 21 resource files into 10 skill references/ directories for self-contained distribution**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-24T21:04:35Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-24T21:05:50Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 21

## Accomplishments

- Created references/ subdirectory in all 10 skills with external kata/ dependencies
- Copied 12 files for high-traffic skills (Wave 1): kata-executing-phases, kata-planning-phases, kata-starting-projects, kata-starting-milestones
- Copied 9 files for remaining skills (Wave 2): kata-verifying-work, kata-completing-milestones, kata-discussing-phases, kata-mapping-codebases, kata-listing-phase-assumptions, kata-resuming-work
- Templates renamed with `-template` suffix for clarity

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Copy resources for high-traffic skills (Wave 1)** - `a95d66e` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Copy resources for remaining skills** - `ccbbdb2` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `ui-brand.md` - Visual patterns for stage banners, checkpoint boxes
- `planning-config.md` - Planning system configuration reference
- `phase-execute.md` - Phase execution workflow

### kata-planning-phases/references/ (1 file)
- `ui-brand.md` - Visual patterns for stage banners, checkpoint boxes

### kata-starting-projects/references/ (4 files)
- `questioning.md` - Question framework for requirements gathering
- `ui-brand.md` - Visual patterns for stage banners, checkpoint boxes

- `requirements-template.md` - REQUIREMENTS.md template

### kata-starting-milestones/references/ (4 files)
- `questioning.md` - Question framework for requirements gathering
- `ui-brand.md` - Visual patterns for stage banners, checkpoint boxes
- `project-template.md` - PROJECT.md template
- `requirements-template.md` - REQUIREMENTS.md template

### kata-verifying-work/references/ (2 files)
- `verify-work.md` - Work verification workflow
- `UAT-template.md` - User Acceptance Testing template

### kata-listing-phase-assumptions/references/ (1 file)
- `phase-assumptions.md` - Phase assumptions workflow

### kata-resuming-work/references/ (1 file)
- `resume-project.md` - Project resume workflow

## Decisions Made

- **Template suffix naming:** Templates copied from kata/templates/ are renamed with `-template` suffix (e.g., `project.md` becomes `project-template.md`) to distinguish them from workflow references in the same directory
- **Duplication accepted:** Same resources (e.g., ui-brand.md) are copied to multiple skills rather than shared, accepting duplication as the cost of skill independence per Claude Code plugin standards

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All 10 skills now have local copies of their required resources
- Ready for plan 02: Update SKILL.md files to reference local resources instead of kata/ paths
- Skills not yet self-contained (still reference @~/.claude/kata/ paths)
