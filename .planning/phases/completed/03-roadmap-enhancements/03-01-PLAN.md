<objective>
Update ROADMAP.md to add future milestone visibility and fix formatting inconsistencies.

Purpose: Satisfy ROAD-01 (future milestones visible) and ROAD-02 (consistent formatting, scannable indicators) by editing the existing ROADMAP.md file directly.
Output: Updated `.planning/ROADMAP.md` with Planned Milestones section, consistent completed milestone formatting, and expanded Progress Summary table.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Standardize completed milestone details blocks</name>
  <files>.planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
Read the current ROADMAP.md. Fix all completed milestone `<details>` blocks to use this exact format:

```
<details>
<summary>✅ v[X.Y] [Name] — SHIPPED [DATE]</summary>

**Goal:** [One sentence milestone goal]

- [x] Phase N: [Name] (N/N plans) — completed [DATE]

[Full archive](milestones/v[X.Y]-ROADMAP.md)

</details>
```

Specific inconsistencies to fix:
1. v1.3.0 Release Automation — missing `[Full archive]` link. Add: `[Full archive](milestones/v1.3.0-ROADMAP.md)`
2. v1.1.0 GitHub Integration — missing **Goal:** line. Add: `**Goal:** GitHub integration with issue sync, PR workflow, and review automation.`
3. v1.0.9 Command Consolidation — uses "COMPLETE" instead of "SHIPPED". Change to "SHIPPED 2026-01-25". Missing **Goal:** line. Add: `**Goal:** Normalize all entry points onto the skills system.`. Missing archive link. Add: `[Full archive](milestones/v1.0.9-ROADMAP.md)` (note: archive may not exist yet, but link should be present for consistency).
4. v1.0.8 Plugin Stability — missing **Goal:** line. Add: `**Goal:** Restructure skill resources for plugin stability.`
5. v1.0.0 Claude Code Plugin — missing **Goal:** line. Add: `**Goal:** Package Kata as a Claude Code plugin for marketplace distribution.`
6. v0.1.5 Skills and Documentation — missing **Goal:** line and archive link format. Add: `**Goal:** Convert commands to skills and establish documentation patterns.`
7. v0.1.4 Hard Fork and Rebrand — missing **Goal:** line. Add: `**Goal:** Fork from upstream and rebrand as Kata.`

Preserve the existing phase listings and checkbox formats within each block. Only add missing elements; do not rewrite content that already matches the standard format.

Note: v1.4.1 and v1.4.0 already have correct formatting with Goal, phases, and archive link. Use those as the reference.
  </action>
  <verify>
Grep ROADMAP.md for all `<details>` blocks and confirm each contains:
- `**Goal:**` line
- `[Full archive]` link
- Summary line uses "SHIPPED" (not "COMPLETE")

Run: `grep -c "Goal:" .planning/ROADMAP.md` should return at least 12 (9 completed milestones + 3 current phases).
  </verify>
  <done>All 9 completed milestone details blocks follow identical format with Goal, phase checkboxes, and archive link.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add Planned Milestones section and update Progress Summary</name>
  <files>.planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
Add a "Planned Milestones" section to ROADMAP.md between the "Completed Milestones" section and the "---" separator before "Current Milestone".

The section should contain 2-3 placeholder planned milestones. Since no specific future milestones have been defined by the user, use reasonable placeholders based on the project trajectory. Format:

```markdown
## Planned Milestones

### v1.6.0 (Planned)

**Goal:** To be defined.

**Target features:**
- TBD

### v1.7.0 (Planned)

**Goal:** To be defined.

**Target features:**
- TBD
```

Update the Milestones overview bullet list at the top to include planned milestones:

```markdown
## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.4.1 Issue Execution** — Phases 1-4 (shipped 2026-02-03)
- 🔄 **v1.5.0 Phase Management** — Phases 1-3 (in progress)
- ○ **v1.6.0** — planned
- ○ **v1.7.0** — planned
```

Update the Progress Summary table to include planned milestones with "Planned" status:

```markdown
| v1.6.0    | —      | —     | Planned  | —          |
| v1.7.0    | —      | —     | Planned  | —          |
```

Add these rows after the v1.5.0 Active row.

Update the "Last updated" footer to today's date: `*Last updated: 2026-02-04 — v1.5.0 Phase 3 roadmap enhancements*`
  </action>
  <verify>
Confirm the following in ROADMAP.md:
1. `grep "## Planned Milestones" .planning/ROADMAP.md` returns a match
2. `grep "○" .planning/ROADMAP.md` returns planned milestone entries
3. `grep "Planned" .planning/ROADMAP.md` returns Progress Summary rows
4. The document renders correctly in a Markdown viewer (no broken HTML)
  </verify>
  <done>ROADMAP.md has a Planned Milestones section with placeholder future milestones, overview bullets include planned entries with circle symbol, and Progress Summary table includes Planned status rows.</done>
</task>

</tasks>
