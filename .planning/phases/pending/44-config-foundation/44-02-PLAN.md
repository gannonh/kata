<objective>
Create the worktree setup script and integrate worktree configuration into both the new-project onboarding flow and the settings skill.

Purpose: Users need three paths to enable worktrees: (1) during new project setup, (2) retroactively via settings, (3) the underlying script that validates the repo and creates the worktrees directory structure. This plan delivers all three.
Output: setup-worktrees.sh script, updated kata-new-project SKILL.md, updated kata-configure-settings SKILL.md.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create setup-worktrees.sh validation and setup script</name>
  <files>skills/kata-configure-settings/scripts/setup-worktrees.sh</files>
  <action>
Create `setup-worktrees.sh` that validates preconditions and prepares the repo for worktree-per-plan execution. This script does NOT convert to a bare repo. Standard (non-bare) git repos already support `git worktree add`, so no conversion is needed. Phase 45's `manage-worktree.sh` handles actual worktree creation/deletion at execution time.

Script requirements:
- `set -euo pipefail`
- `SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"` for sibling script resolution
- Validate preconditions in this order (exit 1 with descriptive message on failure):
  1. `pr_workflow` must be `true` in config: `bash "$SCRIPT_DIR/read-config.sh" "pr_workflow" "false"` — check FIRST because worktrees require PR workflow
  2. Must be in a git repo: `git rev-parse --git-dir > /dev/null 2>&1`
  3. Must have clean working tree: `[ -z "$(git status --porcelain)" ]`
  4. Must NOT already have `.worktrees/` directory: `[ ! -d .worktrees ]`
- Setup steps (only reached if all validations pass):
  1. Create worktrees directory: `mkdir -p .worktrees`
  2. Add `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` if not already present (worktrees are local, not committed)
  3. Set `worktree.enabled: true` via `bash "$SCRIPT_DIR/set-config.sh" "worktree.enabled" "true"`
  4. Print success message: "Worktree isolation enabled. Plans will use .worktrees/ for isolated working directories."
- Make executable: `chmod +x`

Do NOT: convert to bare repo, clone anything, move .git, or modify git internals. The repo stays standard.

  <name>Task 2: Add worktree question to kata-new-project onboarding</name>
  <files>skills/kata-new-project/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Add a 6th question to Phase 5 of kata-new-project, conditional on the user selecting PR workflow = Yes.

Insert AFTER the GitHub Tracking question block (question 5) and BEFORE the `# If GitHub Tracking = Yes` follow-up section:

```
# If PR Workflow = Yes, ask about worktrees:
{
  header: "Git Worktrees",
  question: "Use git worktrees for plan isolation? (each plan agent gets its own branch and working directory)",
  multiSelect: false,
  options: [
    { label: "No (Recommended)", description: "Plans share the working directory (standard git workflow)" },
    { label: "Yes", description: "Each plan gets an isolated worktree and branch (advanced)" }
  ]
}
```

If the user selected PR Workflow = No, skip this question entirely (worktrees require PR workflow).

In the config.json creation block, add the worktree key conditionally:
- If PR Workflow = Yes AND Worktrees = Yes: add `"worktree": { "enabled": true }` to config
- If PR Workflow = Yes AND Worktrees = No: add `"worktree": { "enabled": false }` to config
- If PR Workflow = No: do NOT add worktree key to config (absence = disabled)

If Worktrees = Yes, call setup-worktrees.sh AFTER config.json is written (because the script reads pr_workflow from config):
- Location: Insert the call in the "Write config.json" step of Phase 5, after the `set-config.sh` calls that write pr_workflow and other settings
- Command: `bash "skills/kata-configure-settings/scripts/setup-worktrees.sh"`
- Error handling: If setup-worktrees.sh exits non-zero, print the error and set `worktree.enabled` back to `false` via `bash "skills/kata-configure-settings/scripts/set-config.sh" "worktree.enabled" "false"`. Do NOT abort the entire project setup — worktree failure is non-fatal.

Do NOT restructure existing Phase 5 content. Insert the new question block, conditional config handling, and setup call surgically.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add worktree toggle to kata-configure-settings</name>
  <files>skills/kata-configure-settings/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Add worktree toggle to Section B (Session Settings) of kata-configure-settings.

1. In Step 2 (Read Current Values), add:
```bash
WORKTREE_ENABLED=$(bash "$SCRIPT_DIR/read-pref.sh" "worktree.enabled" "false")
PR_WORKFLOW_VAL=$(bash "$SCRIPT_DIR/read-pref.sh" "pr_workflow" "false")
```

2. In Section B AskUserQuestion, conditionally include a worktree question AFTER the PR Workflow question. The conditional logic:
   - Read `PR_WORKFLOW_VAL` in Step 2 (already added above)
   - If `PR_WORKFLOW_VAL = "true"`, include this question in the AskUserQuestion block:
     ```
     {
       question: "Enable git worktree isolation per plan?",
       header: "Git Worktrees",
       multiSelect: false,
       options: [
         { label: "No", description: "Plans share the working directory (standard)" },
         { label: "Yes", description: "Each plan gets isolated worktree and branch (advanced)" }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - If `PR_WORKFLOW_VAL = "false"`, OMIT this question entirely from the AskUserQuestion block (do not show it, do not change worktree.enabled). Add a comment in the SKILL.md like: `<!-- If pr_workflow is false, skip Git Worktrees question — worktrees require PR workflow -->`

3. In Step 4 (Write Updates), add to the Session Settings block:
```bash
bash "$SCRIPT_DIR/set-config.sh" "worktree.enabled" "$NEW_WORKTREE_ENABLED"
```

4. Add side-effect: If worktree was just enabled (changed from false to true):
```bash
# Run setup after writing the config
if ! bash "$SCRIPT_DIR/setup-worktrees.sh"; then
  echo "Error: Worktree setup failed. Reverting worktree.enabled to false."
  bash "$SCRIPT_DIR/set-config.sh" "worktree.enabled" "false"
fi
```
The explicit exit code check ensures that on setup failure, worktree.enabled is reverted to false via set-config.sh and an error message is shown. The settings flow continues (non-fatal).

5. In Step 5 (Confirm Changes), add row to Session Settings table:
```
| Git Worktrees      | {On/Off}                  |
```

Do NOT restructure existing AskUserQuestion blocks or reorder questions. Insert the worktree question and write logic surgically.
