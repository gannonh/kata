<objective>
Create a Kata glossary defining key terms with clear relationships.

Purpose: Enable users and future Claude instances to quickly understand Kata terminology. The glossary serves as authoritative reference for what terms mean and how concepts relate.

Output: `.docs/glossary/GLOSSARY.md` with definitions, relationships, and visual diagram
</objective>

<execution_context>
Executor agent has built-in instructions for plan execution and summary creation.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create GLOSSARY.md with categorized definitions</name>
  <files>.docs/glossary/GLOSSARY.md</files>
  <action>
Create GLOSSARY.md with comprehensive terminology definitions organized by category.

**Structure:**

```markdown
# Kata Glossary

Overview paragraph explaining this is the authoritative terminology reference.

## Quick Reference

Brief table mapping terms to one-line definitions for scanning.

## Relationship Diagram

Mermaid diagram showing how main concepts relate:
- Project contains Milestones
- Milestone contains Phases
- Phase contains Plans
- Plan contains Tasks
- Skills spawn Agents

## Categories

### Project Structure
Define: Project, Milestone, Phase, Plan, Task
Include relationships (what contains what, what produces what)

### Artifacts
Define: PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, VERIFICATION.md
Include what produces each, when it's created/updated

### Agents and Skills
Define: Skill, Agent (Subagent), Orchestrator
List key skills and their agents
Explain skill vs agent distinction (skills are user-invocable orchestrators, agents are spawned workers)

### Workflows
Define: Planning, Execution, Verification, UAT, Gap Closure
Brief description of each workflow's purpose

### GitHub Integration
Define: GitHub Issue, GitHub Milestone, Pull Request, Branch
Explain how Kata concepts map to GitHub concepts
```

**Format for each term:**
```markdown
### Term Name
**Definition:** One clear sentence.

**Relationships:**
- Produces: X
- Consumed by: Y
- Contains: Z (if container)

**Lifecycle:** State transitions if applicable

**See also:** Related terms
```

Keep definitions concise but complete. Focus on what the term means in Kata context, not general software definitions.

  <verify>
GLOSSARY.md exists with:
- Definitions for: milestone, phase, plan, task, skill, agent
- Definitions for key artifacts: PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md
- Relationship diagram (mermaid block)
- Organized by category
- Cross-references between related terms
  </verify>
  <done>
GLOSSARY.md contains categorized definitions for all key Kata terms with relationships clearly documented.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add relationship diagram to glossary</name>
  <files>.docs/glossary/GLOSSARY.md</files>
  <action>
Ensure the glossary includes a comprehensive Mermaid relationship diagram showing:

1. **Hierarchical Structure:**
```
Project -> Milestone -> Phase -> Plan -> Task
```

2. **Artifact Production:**
```
starting-projects produces PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md
planning-phases produces PLAN.md
executing-phases produces SUMMARY.md
verifying-work produces VERIFICATION.md
```

3. **Skill-Agent Relationships:**
```
planning-phases spawns kata-planner, kata-plan-checker
executing-phases spawns kata-executor
verifying-work spawns kata-verifier, kata-debugger
```

The diagram should be placed early in the document (after intro, before detailed definitions) so readers get visual context before diving into text.

Use flowchart TB with subgraphs for clarity. This diagram complements the FLOWS.md diagrams by focusing on static relationships rather than dynamic workflows.
  </action>
  <verify>
GLOSSARY.md contains:
- At least one mermaid diagram showing concept relationships
- Diagram shows Project->Milestone->Phase->Plan hierarchy
- Diagram shows key skill-agent relationships
  </verify>
  <done>
GLOSSARY.md includes visual relationship diagram alongside text definitions.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. Verify all key terms from ROADMAP, STATE, and CLAUDE.md are defined
2. Verify relationship diagram renders correctly (mermaid.live or GitHub)
3. Verify definitions are consistent with actual usage in codebase
</verification>
