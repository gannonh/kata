<objective>
Update all secondary references from "todo" to "issue" across 6 files that reference the old vocabulary.

**Why:** ISS-01 requires vocabulary change throughout Kata.
</objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update executing-phases skill</name>
  <files>skills/executing-phases/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
    Search and replace:
    - `/kata:add-todo` → `/kata:add-issue`
    - "Create todos" → "Create issues"
    - "pending todos" → "pending issues"
    - Any other todo references in deviation handling or backlog sections
  </action>
  <verify>grep -ci "todo" skills/executing-phases/SKILL.md returns 0 or minimal</verify>
  <done>No todo vocabulary in executing-phases</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update tracking-progress, verifying-work, providing-help, auditing-milestones, and resume-project</name>
  <files>
    skills/tracking-progress/SKILL.md
    skills/verifying-work/SKILL.md
    skills/providing-help/SKILL.md
    skills/auditing-milestones/SKILL.md
    skills/resuming-work/references/resume-project.md
  </files>
  <action>
    For each file, search and replace:
    - "Pending Todos" → "Pending Issues"
    - "/kata:check-todos" → "/kata:check-issues"
    - "/kata:add-todo" → "/kata:add-issue"
    - "todo" → "issue" (where contextually appropriate)
    - ".planning/todos/" → ".planning/issues/"

    Preserve any references that are genuinely about the old system in historical context.

    for f in skills/tracking-progress/SKILL.md skills/verifying-work/SKILL.md skills/providing-help/SKILL.md skills/auditing-milestones/SKILL.md skills/resuming-work/references/resume-project.md; do
      echo "$f: $(grep -ci 'todo' $f || echo 0)"
    done
  </verify>
  <done>All secondary skills updated with issue vocabulary</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<must_haves>
- [ ] No "todo" vocabulary remains in any secondary skill file
- [ ] All commands reference /kata:add-issue and /kata:check-issues
- [ ] Help text accurately describes the issue system
- [ ] Progress tracking shows "Pending Issues" section
</must_haves>
