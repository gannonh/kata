<objective>
Verify DOC-01 and DOC-02 requirements are met by documentation already updated in Phase 51-02, then check off requirements in REQUIREMENTS.md.

Purpose: Close out the documentation requirements for v1.11.0 without redundant work. Phase 51-02 already updated both target files.
Output: REQUIREMENTS.md with DOC-01 and DOC-02 checked off and DOC-01 description corrected.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify DOC-01 — setup-worktrees.sh README template</name>
  <files>skills/kata-configure-settings/scripts/setup-worktrees.sh</files>
  <action>Read lines 170-209 of setup-worktrees.sh and verify ALL of the following against Phase 52 success criteria:
  1. README template shows `workspace/` as persistent working directory — expect line mentioning "workspace/ is the persistent working directory"
  2. README template shows `main/` as read-only — expect line mentioning "main/ is a read-only reference worktree"
  3. Directory structure example includes `workspace/`, `main/`, and `plan-{phase}-{plan}/` — expect structure diagram with all three
  4. Branch layout shows main -> phase branch (in workspace/) -> plan branch hierarchy — expect branch tree diagram

  Output verification results. All four criteria must pass.</action>
  <verify>Read the file and confirm each criterion is met. No command needed — this is a read-and-verify task.</verify>
  <done>All four DOC-01 sub-criteria confirmed present in setup-worktrees.sh README template.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify DOC-02 — git-integration.md branch flow</name>
  <files>skills/kata-execute-phase/references/git-integration.md</files>
  <action>Read lines 256-305 of git-integration.md and verify ALL of the following against Phase 52 success criteria:
  1. Branch flow diagram shows main -> phase branch (in workspace) -> plan branch hierarchy — expect layout diagram and tier descriptions
  2. Directory structure examples include `workspace/`, `main/`, and plan worktree directories — expect structure diagram
  3. Configuration variants table present — expect table with pr_workflow and worktree.enabled combinations
  4. Plan branch lifecycle describes workspace-based flow — expect numbered steps referencing workspace/

  Output verification results. All four criteria must pass.</action>
  <verify>Read the file and confirm each criterion is met. No command needed — this is a read-and-verify task.</verify>
  <done>All four DOC-02 sub-criteria confirmed present in git-integration.md branch_flow section.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update REQUIREMENTS.md — check off DOC-01/DOC-02 and fix DOC-01 description</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>Make two changes to REQUIREMENTS.md:

  1. Check off DOC-01 and DOC-02:
     - Change `- [ ] **DOC-01**:` to `- [x] **DOC-01**:`
     - Change `- [ ] **DOC-02**:` to `- [x] **DOC-02**:`

  2. Fix DOC-01 description to reflect actual architecture:
     - Change: `setup-worktrees.sh` README template reflects new structure (phase worktree as sibling to `main/`)
     - To: `setup-worktrees.sh` README template reflects workspace architecture (`workspace/` as persistent working directory, `main/` as read-only)

  Do NOT change any other content.</action>
  <verify>Read REQUIREMENTS.md and confirm:
  - DOC-01 line starts with `- [x]`
  - DOC-02 line starts with `- [x]`
  - DOC-01 description mentions "workspace architecture" not "phase worktree as sibling"
  - All other requirements unchanged</verify>
  <done>REQUIREMENTS.md shows DOC-01 and DOC-02 checked off. DOC-01 description updated to match workspace model. Traceability table DOC-01 description also updated.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After all tasks:
1. All Phase 52 success criteria verified against source files
2. REQUIREMENTS.md DOC-01 and DOC-02 both checked `[x]`
3. No documentation sections in the target files were modified (verification-only phase)
4. All v1.11.0 requirements now checked off (WT-01 through INV-01, DOC-01, DOC-02)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- DOC-01 verified: setup-worktrees.sh README template shows workspace/, main/, plan worktrees, and branch hierarchy
- DOC-02 verified: git-integration.md branch_flow shows workspace architecture with layout, config variants, and lifecycle
- REQUIREMENTS.md DOC-01 and DOC-02 checkboxes marked [x]
- REQUIREMENTS.md DOC-01 description corrected to "workspace architecture"
- Zero files modified in skills/ directories (verification-only, no doc changes)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/pending/52-documentation-worktree-structure/52-01-SUMMARY.md`
