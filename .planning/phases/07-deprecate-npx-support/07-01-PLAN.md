<objective>
Rename all 27 skill directories by removing the `kata-` prefix.

Purpose: Plugin build already strips the prefix from directories (via `renameSkillDir()`) and from the `name:` frontmatter field (via `transformSkillName()`). By renaming in source, we simplify build.js and make source match distribution.

Output: 27 skill directories renamed, each SKILL.md frontmatter `name:` field updated.
</objective>

<execution_context>
The build.js `renameSkillDir()` and `transformSkillName()` functions currently do this transformation at build time. After this plan, source directories will already have the final form, so those build transforms become no-ops (and can be removed in a later plan).
</execution_context>

Skills directory: `skills/`
Total skills to rename: 27 (excluding kata-updating which is deleted in 07-02)

  <action>
For each skill directory:
1. Rename directory: `git mv skills/kata-{name} skills/{name}`
2. Update SKILL.md frontmatter: change `name: kata-{name}` to `name: {name}`

Use git mv to preserve history. Process all 27 directories (skip kata-updating - deleted in 07-02).

Example for one skill:
```bash
git mv skills/kata-adding-milestones skills/adding-milestones
# Then edit skills/adding-milestones/SKILL.md: name: kata-adding-milestones -> name: adding-milestones
```
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# Verify no kata-* directories remain (except kata-updating which is handled in 07-02)
ls skills/ | grep -E "^kata-" | grep -v kata-updating
# Should return only kata-updating

# Verify all renamed directories exist
ls skills/adding-milestones skills/executing-phases skills/planning-phases 2>/dev/null && echo "OK"

# Verify frontmatter updated (sample check)
grep "^name:" skills/adding-milestones/SKILL.md
# Should show: name: adding-milestones
```

  <files>
    skills/*/SKILL.md
    skills/*/references/*.md
  </files>
  <action>
Search for any `Skill("kata-` invocations within skill files and update them to `Skill("kata:` (the plugin namespace format).

The build.js already transforms these: `Skill("kata-xxx")` -> `Skill("kata:xxx")`. Since we're removing the prefix from source, any internal skill-to-skill references need to use the plugin namespace format.

Search pattern: `Skill\("kata-`
Replace with: `Skill("kata:`

Note: Most skills don't call other skills directly, so this may find zero matches.

```bash
# Verify no Skill("kata- invocations remain

- [ ] `ls skills/ | wc -l` returns 28 (27 renamed + 1 kata-updating)
- [ ] `ls skills/ | grep -E "^kata-"` returns only "kata-updating"
- [ ] `grep -l "^name: kata-" skills/*/SKILL.md` returns only kata-updating
- [ ] `npm run build:plugin` succeeds

<success_criteria>
1. All 27 retained skill directories have kata- prefix removed
2. All 27 SKILL.md frontmatter name fields have kata- prefix removed
3. Any internal Skill() references use plugin namespace format
4. Build succeeds with renamed skills
