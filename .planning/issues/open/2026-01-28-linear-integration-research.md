## Problem

Some teams use Linear instead of (or alongside) GitHub Issues for project management. Kata currently only supports GitHub integration.

## Solution

Research phase (not implementation):
- Understand Linear API capabilities
- Map Kata concepts to Linear (milestones → cycles/projects, phases → issues, etc.)
- Document integration architecture
- Identify blockers/challenges

## Scope

Discovery and documentation only. Implementation deferred to future milestone after GitHub integration is proven.

## Context

Deferred from v1.3.0 milestone. Listed in PROJECT.md Out of Scope: "Other integrations (Linear, Jira) — after GitHub proves pattern"
