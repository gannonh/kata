# Phase 2.1: GitHub Repo Setup — User Acceptance Testing

**Phase Goal:** Ensure GitHub repository exists before milestone/issue creation can proceed

## Tests

### Test 1: Remote detection in starting-projects
**Expected:** When running `/kata:starting-projects` with GitHub tracking enabled in a project without a GitHub remote, you should see an AskUserQuestion offering to create a public repo, private repo, or skip.

**Result:** ✓ PASS

---

### Test 2: Skip repo creation disables GitHub
**Expected:** If you choose "Skip for now" when prompted to create a repo, the config.json should show `github.enabled: false` and you should see a note explaining how to enable it later.

**Result:** ⊘ SKIPPED (user took different path)

---

### Test 3: Milestone creation skips GitHub when no remote
**Expected:** When running `/kata:starting-milestones` in a project without a GitHub remote (but with `github.enabled: true` in config), you should see a warning message about missing remote and instructions to run `gh repo create`, but local milestone creation should still proceed.

**Result:** _pending_

---

### Test 4: Milestone creation uses GitHub when remote exists
**Expected:** When running `/kata:starting-milestones` in a project WITH a GitHub remote and `github.enabled: true`, it should attempt to create a GitHub Milestone (auth check first, then milestone creation via `gh api`).

**Result:** _pending_

| 1 | Remote detection in starting-projects | ✓ PASS |
| 2 | Skip repo creation disables GitHub | ⊘ SKIPPED |
| 3 | Milestone creation skips GitHub when no remote | ⏸ PENDING |
| 4 | Milestone creation uses GitHub when remote exists | ⏸ PENDING |

**Status:** 1/4 tests passed, 1 skipped, 2 pending
**Note:** Tests 3-4 pending due to Phase 2.2 insertion (decoupling project init from milestone setup)
