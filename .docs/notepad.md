IDEAS:

Improving skill recall:
- install hook remnding claude to check skills before responding to any prompt; install rules for when to load which skills

Add-on extensions
- create progressive discloosure files with special naming convention: 
  - eg, `skills/kata-managing-project-roadmap/references/phase-operations.ext.github.md` 
  - that run alongside main resource file `skills/kata-managing-project-roadmap/references/phase-operations.md`
- add-on extensions are part of project init, saved to `.planning/config.json`

Project Documentation
- new project onboarding creates README and CHANGELOG using templates
- docs are updated as part of milestone completion / PR merging process
